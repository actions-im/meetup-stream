Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.

New media has become an increasingly viable way for individuals to tell their personal stories and engage audiences. In a time when many first-generation artists are enjoying their successes far beyond their national borders, how do new media artists transgress the practical and symbolic boundaries within the hierarchy of their artistic, cultural and economic recognition? How do they imagine the world of new media art? This panel aims to explore the current trends of media arts, with the intention of uncovering how new modes of production, distribution, and exhibition have fundamentally changed the landscape of cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Kingsley Ng&nbsp;received postgraduate training at Le Fresnoy – National Studio of Contemporary Arts in France, an MSc in Sustainable Design from University of Edinburgh in the UK. He has participated in “Agora Festival” (IRCAM, Centre Pompidou, Paris, France, 2006), “Echigo Tsumari Art Triennial” (Niigata, Japan, 2009), “Guangzhou Triennial” (Guangzhou, China, 2012), “Digital Life” (Mustum of Contemporary Arts, Rome, Italy, 2014). His awards include the Arts Development Council Best Artist Award in Media Arts 2014, the Asian Cultural Council Grant 2013, and Hong Kong Contemporary Art Biennial Awards 2009. He is currently a lecturer at the Hong Kong Baptist University Academy of Visual Arts.<\/p>\n<p>Island 6 Art Collective (Liu Dao)&nbsp;is an innovative artist collective based in Shanghai. Driven by collaboration at every step, this diverse group of new media artists, technological talents, and creative thinkers have been active around the globe since Liu Dao’s founding in 2006. With members hailing from eclectic artistic, technical, and academic backgrounds, Liu Dao seeks to create unexpected media combinations that balance the delicate qualities of traditional art with the technical complexities of the contemporary. Liu Dao’s work often includes such unique pairings as high-definition photographs coupled with dynamic LED animations, and traditional Chinese paper cutting matched with cutting-edge video art. The acclaimed collective has been invited to exhibit their work in solo and group exhibitions around the world, including at the Louis Vuitton Cultural Spaces in Taipei and Macau, the Smithsonian Anacostia Museum, and the Rockbund Museum. Liu Dao’s work is included in the K11 Collection in Shanghai and the White Rabbit Collection in Sydney, among many others.<\/p>\n<p>Yang Yeung&nbsp;is an independent curator, writer and university lecturer.

New media has become an increasingly viable way for individuals to tell their personal stories and engage audiences. In a time when many first-generation artists are enjoying their successes far beyond their national borders, how do new media artists transgress the practical and symbolic boundaries within the hierarchy of their artistic, cultural and economic recognition? How do they imagine the world of new media art? This panel aims to explore the current trends of media arts, with the intention of uncovering how new modes of production, distribution, and exhibition have fundamentally changed the landscape of cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Kingsley Ng&nbsp;received postgraduate training at Le Fresnoy – National Studio of Contemporary Arts in France, an MSc in Sustainable Design from University of Edinburgh in the UK.

His awards include the Arts Development Council Best Artist Award in Media Arts 2014, the Asian Cultural Council Grant 2013, and Hong Kong Contemporary Art Biennial Awards 2009. He is currently a lecturer at the Hong Kong Baptist University Academy of Visual Arts.<\/p>\n<p>Island 6 Art Collective (Liu Dao)&nbsp;is an innovative artist collective based in Shanghai. Driven by collaboration at every step, this diverse group of new media artists, technological talents, and creative thinkers have been active around the globe since Liu Dao’s founding in 2006. With members hailing from eclectic artistic, technical, and academic backgrounds, Liu Dao seeks to create unexpected media combinations that balance the delicate qualities of traditional art with the technical complexities of the contemporary. Liu Dao’s work often includes such unique pairings as high-definition photographs coupled with dynamic LED animations, and traditional Chinese paper cutting matched with cutting-edge video art. The acclaimed collective has been invited to exhibit their work in solo and group exhibitions around the world, including at the Louis Vuitton Cultural Spaces in Taipei and Macau, the Smithsonian Anacostia Museum, and the Rockbund Museum.

Today, while numerous contemporary artists allude to traditional Chinese pictorial and calligraphic concepts in their visual vocabulary, there are far fewer artists whose work suggests a conscientious effort to engage with and transform this ancient Chinese art form as a defining feature of their artistic vision. This forum will invite four emerging young artists whose artistic voice meaningfully reference the age-old “ink aesthetic” with the use of new artistic media and techniques. Representing different major modern ink art centers in Asia, and having all exhibited and\/or worked abroad, these young globally conscious contemporary artists share background in traditional ink painting yet explore radically different methodologies in their new \"ink\" artwork to access a global audience. During the forum, these neo-traditionalist artists will discuss their artistic practice, and how they have been able to transform, extend and reconstruct the ink tradition in a postmodern context.<\/p>\n<p>Hung Fai&nbsp;born in Hong Kong (1988), graduated from the Fine Arts department of The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2013 and is currently working as a full-time artist in Hong Kong. Hung Fai’s creation focuses mainly on the field of contemporary Chinese ink art. Hung has developed unique expression and presentation techniques on both paper and canvas. Through deconstruction of elements in traditional Chinese ink paintings, his works are reconstructed conceptually with series of experimentation and transformation, and extended possibilities in ink painting. Hung Fai has exhibited in Hong Kong and held a solo exhibition “Movement - Hung Fai” in 2014. He has received awards including the Certificates of Merit - Hong Kong Art Prize 2013, Wucius Wong Creative Ink Painting Award (2013), among others. His works have been collected by M+ Museum for Visual Culture, Hong Kong and private collectors.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Wai&nbsp;born in mainland China (1982) and raised in Macao is an ink transmedia artist based in Paris and Macao. She journeys with ink to a new frontier, that of the mysterious feminine, though the technique has been confined to a masculine universe for centuries. Her works have been exhibited worldwide, from Macao, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, Singapore, Melbourne, Montreal, London, Paris, and featured in various exhibitions, art fairs and international publications. Her doctoral studies are on the deceased ink painter Wu Guangzhong. Hong’s latest joint exhibition was&nbsp;Like Thunder Out of China&nbsp;in Montreal\/Toronto together with artists Gao Brothers, Hung Tunglu, Cang Xin , Zhang Huan, Chang Lei, Lu Feifei and Dai Guangyu.<\/p>\n<p>Peng Wei&nbsp;born in Chengdu, China (1974) and lives and works in Beijing. She graduated from Nankai University with a BA in Fine Art in 1997, and earned a MPhil in Aesthetics in 2000. From 2000 to 2006 she was editor for ART Magazine. Peng Wei is a conservator of Chinese aesthetics, updating and revitalizing elements of classical Chinese painting and bringing her fresh perspective to ancient Chinese art forms. Paying particular attention to materials and iconography, Peng Wei is perhaps best known for her delicate ink color paintings on silk and paper which combine imagery of traditional literati painting with more modern forms and expressions from everyday life. Peng Wei’s works have been exhibited extensively around Asia and have been collected by the Boston Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the National Art Museum of China, the Hong Kong Museum of Art, the M+ Museum, the Uli Sigg Collection, among others.<\/p>\n<p>Ni Youyu&nbsp;(b. 1984) graduated from the department of Chinese Painting, College of Fine Arts, Shanghai University in 2007. He currently lives and works in Shanghai. Although trained in traditional Chinese landscape painting, today Ni Youyu’s art diverges from traditional media by embracing contemporary and more experimental practices or re-inventing traditional Chinese media. As a process of deconstructing art history, Ni Youyu often creates thought provoking multimedia works through processes of erasure and erosion. In 2014 Ni Youyu was awarded “Best Young Artist” at the Contemporary Chinese Art Awards (CCAA) and in 2012 he was also the youngest artist to be given a solo exhibition at the Shanghai Art Museum. His works have been exhibited extensively around the world and have been collected by several museums around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Tiffany Wai-Ying Beres&nbsp;is an independent art curator, whose research focuses on modern and contemporary Chinese ink art. Born in San Francisco, California to a bi-racial family, Tiffany grew up practicing ink painting and calligraphy, stimulating her interest in Chinese art and art history. After graduating from Brown University and apprenticing in the Asian antiquities field, she moved to China on a Fulbright fellowship to explore ink art in its native milieu and to meet the artists revolutionizing the field. From 2007 to 2010, Tiffany served as international affairs officer and a Chinese ink painting specialist for China Guardian, China’s largest auction house, before returning to work directly with artists. Tiffany has conducted exhibitions in the USA, France, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Mainland China and is a frequent lecturer on the topic of Chinese art. In addition to working with celebrated ink art masters, Tiffany has a particular passion for discovering and exposing young ink artists. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<b>Please note:&nbsp;This is a non-host event but one that we think will interest the members of the Hong Kong Expats.

In April of the following year, he married Joy in a private civil ceremony to prevent her deportation.<\/p> \n<p>It is merely coincidence that Lewis married a woman named Joy. The title of this book was not intended to be associated with her. Rather, the title comes from a Wordsworth poem:<\/p> \n<p> Surprised by joy - impatient as the Wind<\/p> \n<p> I wished to share the transport - Oh! with whom<\/p> \n<p> But Thee, long buried in the silent Tomb,<\/p> \n<p> That spot which no vicissitude can find?<\/p> \n<p>The book is not a comprehensive autobiography, but rather contains only the people, events and ideas that were part of Lewis's journey toward faith. In the opinion of one reviewer, \"the deliberate, methodical way in which Lewis narrates his life parallels the meticulous arguments with which he constructed scholarly treatise and theological brief alike.\" (Dr. Bruce Edwards, Bowling Green State University, \"Surprised by Joy by C. S. Lewis: A Critical Summary and Overview\" at<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/personal.bgsu.edu\/-edwards\/surprised.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/personal.bgsu.edu\/-edwards\/surprised.html<\/a>.)<\/p> \n<p>Susan Wise Bauer offers an excellent summary of Surprised by Joy in her guide to reading the classics:<\/p> \n<p>Lewis's autobiography is partly the story of his intellectual and imaginative development, and partly the tale of his coming to grips with Christian faith. This double tale is haunted by the possibility that the two might conflict, perhaps fatally. The title of Lewis's story comes from his attempt to discover the source of Joy, a piercing experience that he is not entirely able to describe in words . . . . Lewis's pursuit of Joy turns out to be the thread that binds his intellect and his faith together. At first, he chases Joy with his intellect, studying Norse mythology and other subjects that have brought him that unexpected stab of Joy in the past. The middle section of the book traces Lewis's education, painting a delightfully vivid portrait of his life at school, the tutor who introduces him to Greek, and his delight in finding book after book that speaks directly to his longing for Joy.<\/p> \n<p>But as Lewis's delight turns \"imperceptibly into a scholars' interest,\" he realizes that Joy has flown. . . . Joy, imagination, and intellect do not come together until the story's end, when Lewis's will is finally converted in a way that is completely inaccessible to his reason . . . . Only then does Lewis again find himself able to experience Joy-not as an end in itself, but as a signpost pointing him to the divine. (Susan Wise Bauer, The Well-Educated Mind: A Guide to the Classical Education You Never Had, W. W. Norton &amp; Company (2003), pp. 155-56.)<\/p> \n<p>As you read, think about how God has shaped your life. What experiences influenced you? Which people?

Sim’s work is a tangible expression of the desire to unlock and blur boundaries of forms within the city. He has worked on depictions of the local cityscape and the urban architecture intensively. His work is a compilation of his own observations, reminiscences and tactile senses towards the ever-changing city. Sim was awarded “40under40” global creative talent by Perspective Magazine in 2013. In the same year, he was commissioned to create a public art installation at Hong Kong Arts Centre. Sim’s work has been exhibited in different cities such as Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Singapore, Tokyo, Thailand and Melbourne. His artworks have been collected by private collectors in Hong Kong and abroad.<\/p>\n<p>Movana Chen&nbsp;is a Hong Kong-based artist who studied fashion design at the London College of Fashion and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the RMIT University in Hong Kong. Movana started her knitting projects in 2004, her work is a multi-disciplinary fusion of media, fashion, performance, installation and sculpture which has been presented at different exhibitions, art festivals and events globally, including those in Hong Kong, London, Paris, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Sicily, Melbourne and Rotterdam. Her recent solo projects include at ArtisTree (Hong Kong, 2013), Chinart LaGalerie (Paris, 2011), Shin Hwa Gallery (Hong Kong, 2009), Pekin Fine Arts (Beijing, 2008). She has also participated in group exhibitions at Frankston arts center (Melbourne, 2015), Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2014), CODA Museum (Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, 2013), MoA Museum of Art Seoul National University (Korea, 2012), Escape Louis Vuitton (Hong Kong and Singapore, 2012), Gyeonggi MoMA (Korea, 2009) and MoCA Shanghai Museum (Shanghai, 2008). Movana was one of the 30 finalists of the 2011 and 2012 Sovereign Asian Art Prize. Her art works have been collected by the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, Louis Vuitton and private collectors from Hong Kong, China and France. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ho Sui Nam South&nbsp;(South Ho) a Hong Kong-based photographer, explores the societal concerns of his native metropolis through the camera. While his earlier works were inspired by personal experiences and states of mind, the artist has gradually wandered into commenting on the society and era he lives in. Through his lens, he depicts the buildings containing the potential homes as beautiful, objects of desire, but also distant. They appear cold and the reflections of their lights in the dark waters are somehow unsettling. According to the artist, the focus of the image is “further than infinity,” a distant symbol of the unattainability of the buildings portrayed. His photos are displayed in light boxes, which allude to the neon lights and billboards used to advertise and create desire. To the artist, the pursuit of material goals is in vain and valuing money or real estate over self-fulfillment is superficial.<\/p>\n<p>Stanley Siu&nbsp;grew up and studied in New Zealand, returning to Hong Kong after graduation. Since then he has practiced as an architect on a number of residential, commercial, master planning, cultural and sustainability projects in Hong Kong and China. Stanley’s professional activities and interests are split equally between architecture and contemporary art. In 2012 Stanley founded Daydreamers Design, an art &amp;design collaboration constantly engaged in the art, design, and architectural scene locally and globally. Under his leadership, Daydreamers Design won the Gold Award for “Rising Moon” presented at the 2013 Lantern Wonderland competition organized by The Hong Kong Tourism Board. In 2014, Stanley became partner at100ft Park, an artist run space aiming to provide an open platform for the local young artists to share their creative thoughts. In the same year, Stanley received the Young Architect Awards 2013 organized by the Hong Kong Institute of Architects; a prestigious award that honours and acknowledges the talents and contribution of Stanley’s achievements in the field of Art and Architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Laure Raibaut&nbsp;is an expert in Chinese Contemporary art. She was trained as an archaeologist of China and earned MA from SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies) in London and the Sorbonne in Paris. She started her career after attending CAFA (Central Academy of Fine Arts) in Beijing and worked for Platform China Art Institute. In 2007, she opened Chinese Contemporary's New York space. As the art market shifted towards Asia, she joined Schoeni Art gallery in Hong Kong, another of the leading galleries in the world for Chinese contemporary art, established in 1992. Laure launched the Asian Contemporary art department for Bonhams, in Hong Kong in 2013 and has since joined Christie's where she is Vice-President, Senior Specialist and Head of Sale for Alexandra House, for the Asian contemporary art department. Her global experience allows her to develop relationships with artists, dealers, curators and collectors and to keep expanding her wide knowledge and ability to assess the market. A French national, Laure is fluent in English, Mandarin and Spanish.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Please note:&nbsp;This is a non-host event but one that we think will interest the members of the Hong Kong Expats.

Black salt is made by burning herbs till they are completely burnt. Then you would scrape your cauldron out with your athame and mix it with sea salt. The herbs selected must have protective properties and can be 1 type or multiple types. Black salt is used to rid yourself of negative energies, ward evil spirits, honoring the crone, helping souls to journey into the afterlife, honoring the dark moon, helping with exorcisms, help with your nightmares or bad dreams, casting a line near your doorways to keep evil out, binding work and more. If you would like to join us to watch us make this or make some for your own, please feel free to attend.

We are at the start of Autumn, and people around Australia gather for a Taste of Harmony – an initiative which celebrates the diversity of multicultural Australia. In the last picnic, we had dishes from South America to Italy and many nations in between. It was lovely to hear about different cultures and how their ancestors used to prepare wholefood. The 28th March is marks the near end of MeatFreeWeek - which is a global campaign to get you thinking about how much meat you eat, and the impact eating too much has on your health, animals and the environment. We're not just talking about red meat (beef, lamb and pork), but all meat, including poultry, processed meat (like ham, bacon, salami and packaged sandwich meats), fish and seafood. Why not share this campaign with your friends and family?<\/p> \n<p> Let’s blend these initiatives for one BIG celebration and picnic at Botanical Gardens<\/p> \n<p>Bring your favourite plant based dish to share with a beautiful picnic. The attendees loved the location with amazing views of Sydney. What to bring? <br>- Food enough to share with 3 more people <br>- A picnic rug to sit on <br>- Water\/Drink for yourself to drink <br>- Your own plate and cutlery <br>- Frisbee\/Football This time around we can dedicate one person to bring plates for the group. It saves each person bringing a plate. If you are stuck for ideas, the easiest thing to bring is simply a bowl of fruit or a salad. <br>The meeting point is at the Henry Lawson Gate on Mrs Macquarie Road. Botanical Gardens. As you enter Henry Lawson Gate, turn right and we'll be sitting about 50 metres away. Wet Weather Plans: <br>I live very close to the Botanical Gardens, so we'll have the party at my place. Getting there: As per the map, its a 20 min walk from Town Hall. Or 10 Minutes from St James Station.

The park’s topographic diversity from sea level to 1,940 feet elevation supports a variety of bird habitat. Great Horned, Western Screech, Northern Pygmy and Barred Owls are year-round residents. This is common territory for Pileated Woodpecker and Red-breasted Sapsuckers, as well as wintering Bald Eagles. Marine birds include Double-crested and Pelagic Cormorants, Great Blue Herons and colorful Harlequin Ducks.

But there's just one problem – he doesn't want to lead his flock! Then famine grips Guangdong Province, and the sheep are in mortal danger. Will Rodney rise to the challenge, and save their woolly hides? Find out in this shaggy tale of shyness, sheep and an awful lot of luck!<\/p> \n<p>As with all of the Chinese Calendar Tales, the story highlights some fantastic Chinese culture and history. This time, it's the famous Legend of the Five Rams of Guangzhou, as well as the history of rice cultivation in China. Not to mention the special characteristics of people born in the Year of the Ram (or Goat or Sheep depending on your fancy!). They're creative, romantic and charming, but they're also very shy, they hate confrontation and they really don't like standing out. The story is written in fast-paced rhyming verse, with lots of fun and hidden jokes included, and is once again brilliantly illustrated by Harry Harrison, Hong Kong's famous award-winning cartoonist. Join author Sarah Brennan for an interactive, fun-filled afternoon of storytelling, games, and more at Asia Society Hong Kong Center’s Landscape Terrace – conducted in English, suitable for children aged 7-10, casual attire recommended. The Tale of Rodney Ram will be available for sale at the program.<\/p> \n<p>Sarah Brennan is a Hong Kong-based international author and publisher of Chinese Calendar Tales (The Tale of Chester Choi, The Tale of Run Run Rat, The Tale of Oswald Ox, The Tale of Temujin, The Tale of Rhonda Rabbit, The Tale of Pin Yin Panda, The Tale of Sybil Snake, The Tale of a Dark Horse and her latest title The Tale of Rodney Ram to date) as well as the hugely popular Dirty Story series. A featured author in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing International Literary Festivals since 2004, Sarah conducts regular reading tours, workshops and weeks in residence in schools in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, Australia and the UK. Her books are now also distributed in the United States and Canada.<\/p> \n<p>A committed Writer Ambassador for Room to Read, a global non-profit which seeks to transform the lives of millions of children in ten developing countries through its Literacy and Girls’ Education Programs, Sarah shares what “the great Horace Mann once said that “a house without books is like a room without windows”. Room To Read knocks windows through walls and lets the light come blazing in”. Sarah’s particular mission is to bring Chinese culture, history and landscape to young English speakers everywhere through the medium of humor, verse and funny illustrations, while at the same time giving children living in East Asia stories that relate to their own heritage. She also believes passionately in rich vocabulary and intelligent text for primary school children: “dumbing down” is her particular bête noir. As a result, her books can be read on many levels and are popular among children aged as young as 5 and as old as 12.<\/p>","name":"[MEET AUTHOR] The Tale of Rodney Ram","group":{"id":1667555,"category":{"id":16,"name":"language\/ethnic identity","shortname":"language"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/7\/1\/600_31287761.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/7\/1\/highres_31287761.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/7\/1\/thumb_31287761.jpeg","photo_id":31287761},"group_lat":22.27,"name":"The Hong Kong Expats","group_lon":114.14,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"The-Hong-Kong-Expats","country":"hk","city":"Hong Kong"}}

But there's just one problem – he doesn't want to lead his flock! Then famine grips Guangdong Province, and the sheep are in mortal danger. Will Rodney rise to the challenge, and save their woolly hides? Find out in this shaggy tale of shyness, sheep and an awful lot of luck!<\/p>\n<p>As with all of the Chinese Calendar Tales, the story highlights some fantastic Chinese culture and history. This time, it's the famous Legend of the Five Rams of Guangzhou, as well as the history of rice cultivation in China. Not to mention the special characteristics of people born in the Year of the Ram (or Goat or Sheep depending on your fancy!). They're creative, romantic and charming, but they're also very shy, they hate confrontation and they really don't like standing out. The story is written in fast-paced rhyming verse, with lots of fun and hidden jokes included, and is once again brilliantly illustrated by Harry Harrison, Hong Kong's famous award-winning cartoonist. Join author Sarah Brennan for an interactive, fun-filled afternoon of storytelling, games, and more at Asia Society Hong Kong Center’s Landscape Terrace – conducted in English, suitable for children aged 7-10, casual attire recommended. The Tale of Rodney Ram will be available for sale at the program.<\/p>\n<p>Sarah Brennan is a Hong Kong-based international author and publisher of Chinese Calendar Tales (The Tale of Chester Choi, The Tale of Run Run Rat, The Tale of Oswald Ox, The Tale of Temujin, The Tale of Rhonda Rabbit, The Tale of Pin Yin Panda, The Tale of Sybil Snake, The Tale of a Dark Horse and her latest title The Tale of Rodney Ram to date) as well as the hugely popular Dirty Story series. A featured author in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing International Literary Festivals since 2004, Sarah conducts regular reading tours, workshops and weeks in residence in schools in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, Australia and the UK. Her books are now also distributed in the United States and Canada.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/asiasociety.org\/files\/uploads\/432images\/0321_SB.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>A committed Writer Ambassador for Room to Read, a global non-profit which seeks to transform the lives of millions of children in ten developing countries through its Literacy and Girls’ Education Programs, Sarah shares what “the great Horace Mann once said that “a house without books is like a room without windows”. Room To Read knocks windows through walls and lets the light come blazing in”. Sarah’s particular mission is to bring Chinese culture, history and landscape to young English speakers everywhere through the medium of humor, verse and funny illustrations, while at the same time giving children living in East Asia stories that relate to their own heritage. She also believes passionately in rich vocabulary and intelligent text for primary school children: “dumbing down” is her particular bête noir. As a result, her books can be read on many levels and are popular among children aged as young as 5 and as old as 12.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><b>Please note:&nbsp;This is a non-host event but one that we think will interest the members of the Hong Kong Expats.

For this month, we will be at <b>Aperture Studio<\/b> at 2840 Chatham Street in Philadelphia, PA. We will have ample space to work in, allowing models and photographers to concentrate on a variety of creative ideas. Photographers are encouraged to bring items they need to be creative, keeping in mind to have any setups reasonable. Most props are encouraged (no weapon props or open flames) to help with adding originality. The model list will be updated as we get close to the event, so check back frequently for the latest additions. <br><\/p> \n<p>Of <b>special note for this event<\/b>, we are EXTREMELY pleased to present a very cool music experience. <b>Little War Twins<\/b> (http:\/\/www.littlewartwins.com\/) will be <b>performing <\/b>a killer set of music that will be sure to please everyone. Check out their site, listen to their music (buy their download!), and you will be excited to see them live.

Each noise a voice in itself, telling a story whether he wanted to hear it nor not, cascading from above, or rolling in from below. From all angles it came at him, tugging at his purposeful walk. Despite the shouts of angry patrons, or the cooing of false promises from the beauties he passed by, his feet kept him moving forward. The street lamps blanketed the sidewalk with their own cadence, as if he was walking across a chessboard. Trash cans stood as squat sentries, some overflowing with the debris of convenience, some with fire playing above the rim for a few seeking warmth. Puddles from the days rain were splashed at times by transporters whose passengers did not want to stop, but were still in search of something unspoken. The moon struggled to peak out around the shadowed clouds, hinting that the night was soon to be bathed in her fullness, even if the chill of darkness kept the body moving. <\/p> \n<p>He rounded the corner to find himself on Aramingo, or that's what it used to be called. His great-grandfather, affectionately called G-Papp, used to say that before the Great Change, the streets used to have metal signs that read with their name, and that people used cars or buses to get where they were going. His stories of traffic lights, pot holes, convenience stores, and the trappings of the Pre-Change culture seemed so far away. People used to walk and mingle on the streets as part of their daily lives, breathing the air without using a thelium tube. So strange to him! Breathing the air as it was, with no concern of a painful termination. To no such worries. It must have been quite an experience. <\/p> \n<p>His thoughts ended as approached the alley he knew well. A nondescript, typical entry way between sub domes, that was often shrouded by shadows of curving roofs. He was sure that while some things from the past were kept, much was abandoned to embrace the symmetry of the Ones. But alleys seemed to be harbor secrets, and this one held a special secret that not many knew of. Dropping his spare thelium tube on purpose, he bent to pick it up, making the signal with his thumb and forefinger. Within moments, a flash of light pierced out from the shadows of the alley, giving him clearance. He gave a cursory glance around him, knowing that for the next few seconds, the millions of cameras watching his every move would be hit with a few seconds of static, giving him enough time to step into the darkness and through the faux door that was opened for him. <\/p> \n<p>The only sound of the door closing was a faint bump, and then silence. The viso droids fluttered around him, scanning for any potential bugs or, as the old school term was called, a 'wire'. He wasn't worried, as he was a regular here, and they knew him. But familiarity did not mean access, and within moments he heard the beep of approval from the viso droids. <\/p> \n<p>Light spilled out in front of him as a second door opened up. He passed through, stepping out of the darkness and into the light, hearing then the voices of others who came here for the same purpose. It was a big crowd today, not the usual handful of people using their credits for a brief escape. He made sure he had a few extra vrillars to spend before walking over, allowing himself the luxury of options, something that he seldom had the chance to do. <\/p> \n<p>Placing his coat on a hook at his usual station, he sat before red screen he knew so well. He removed his thelium tube and placed it on the desk in front of him, and reamained still as the machine slowly encased him in what was affectionately called the pod.&nbsp; He felt his feet become secured to the floor, soon followed by his arms being locked down onto the arm rest, and then his head to the rest. The computer's voice then said \"Close your eyes, please,\" and he complied with out any fight. The machine felt a bit gruff to some, but he had long embraced the rigidity as a part of the process. <\/p> \n<p>\"Scanning thought waves,\" it said. A brief hum followed, which he called the tuning fork. It always reminded him of the nitrous gas one had to breath during implant process when he was young, when you didn't know enough to object to the mandated micro-chipping. You were old enough to know that something was going on, but too young to ask questions. But he learned to fix that problem later on, along with a few other things. He was one of the lucky ones. <\/p> \n<p>When the tuning fork was done, the machine's voice continued. <\/p> \n<p>\"Destination?\" <\/p> \n<p>\"Philadelphia,\" he responded. \"2015, April.\"<\/p> \n<p>\"Stand by,\" it came back with. He could swear it sounded a slight bit agitated, but he often over thought such things. <\/p> \n<p>\"Pass code?\" it asked, sounding pleasantly inhuman but predictable. <\/p> \n<p>\"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux,\" he responded, as he felt the system begin the transport process. G-Papp always talked about how it was a life changing time for him, because he didn't have toys like this when he was young. He knew his great-grandfather, were he alive today, would be amazed at the ability to thought travel. He owed him everything, as G-Papp's DNA was in his blood too. That gave him access to so many experiences that he would otherwise never have. &nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>\"Does not compute. Repeat,\" came the response. Damn, this unit didn't have a translator installed, he thought. But it didn't matter which model he had, as they all did the same job. You work with what you got. <\/p> \n<p>\"Hear, See, Sexy, Light,\" he responded. And that was it. The machine took over, placing his body in the usual temp stasis, while his mind was then taken back to a date that made history.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/5\/e\/600_434973630.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><br> <\/p> \n<br>","name":"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux","group":{"id":398123,"category":{"id":27,"name":"photography","shortname":"photography"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/600_434703216.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/highres_434703216.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/thumb_434703216.jpeg","photo_id":434703216},"group_lat":39.96,"name":"Philadelphia Glamour Photography Group","state":"PA","group_lon":-75.2,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"The-Philadelphia-Glamour-Photography-Group","country":"us","city":"Philadelphia"}}

The hike will begin at the Dana Point Harbor pier, next to the landmark Pilgrim tall ship and the Ocean Institute. We will proceed south along the marina to the bridge over the harbor turning right on Dana Drive north to the Yacht Club. We will then head south on the ocean side of Dana Drive to its terminus having a spectacular view of the harbor's ocean access. Again, reversing directions, we take the marina front side walk back over the bridge to the park area that is our point of beginning. This route is very popular with local residents and their four legged friends. We are taking this walk at a time of day that enjoys a brisk ocean breeze and setting sun.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>GENERAL RATING: Level One (beginner) for distance, elevation and pace. The slow paced walk is on a side walk with beautiful marina and ocean views that is mostly flat with a few stairs.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/e\/600_382462302.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>ABOUT THE PICNIC: Our picnic will be in a park setting with multiple picnic tables on the oceanfront side of the Ocean Institute overlooking the harbor turning basin - one of the premier places for a picnic in OC! BYOB (beverage) and potluck delectables to share. While our picnic area may be alcohol free, we will exercise adult discretion and our Fifth Amendment rights!<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/4\/a\/600_423907242.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>DRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point, turn on to Dana Point Harbor Drive and follow it to the \"end.\" There are multiple parking areas that serve the OC Marine Institute, Pilgrim tall ship and the Marine Institute. The Meetup location will be in front of the Dana Point Harbor pier adjacent to the Pilgrim tall ship and the Ocean Institute. The picture below is of the Meetup location.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/3\/2\/600_379477682.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p> ADDITIONAL NOTES: Regular walking shoes, not hiking boots, are appropriate as you will be walking on paved side walks. The walk is dog friendly for leashed animals. The picnic area is adjacent to the parking area so there will be no need to carry picnic items on our walk. You may wish to bring a camp chair for added comfort at our picnic. Given the ocean breeze and setting sun, a warm jacket is advisable for the picnic. While alcohol may not be allowed in the park, we will exercise adult discretion and fifth amendment rights for our picnic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/6\/600_408481782.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: Group organizer and assistant organizers assume no liability; hike at your own risk.

From the American Legion Post, the hike takes the ocean front board walk north to the Newport Pier. At the pier, you have a choice. &nbsp;You can take off shoes and take on a bare foot walk along the wet, hard pack sand and surf to Balboa Pier. Or you can walk the same 1.5 mile distance on the board walk to Balboa Pier. &nbsp;We regroup at the Pier, having rest rooms and drinking fountains. &nbsp;With a short walk through the Balboa Fun Zone and along Newport Harbor, we resume our walk along the ocean front board walk back to the American Legion Post.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/d\/7\/4\/600_366555732.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>HIKING DISTANCE: 4.5 miles round trip on sand and\/or boardwalk&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>HIKING TIME: 90 Minutes&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>HIKING DIFFICULTY: Advanced beginner hike with relaxed pace. &nbsp;Flat, but the sand adds to the level of difficulty.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/0\/4\/600_366556132.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>FOLLOWING THE HIKE: The Post offers a six dollar burger with all the \"fix ins\" and three dollar house wine and draft beer! This American Legion Post is a membership facility that limits access to five guests per my membership. &nbsp;For those hikers completing the walk and requesting entry, access will be provided on a space available basis. We generally have multiple Legion members on the hike to facilitate the group's access. &nbsp;The Post's patio is both sand and marina bay front that enables Meetup friendships with a lovely dining experience. There will be no RSVP limits on the Pier to Pier hike with a multitude of&nbsp;dining alternatives available on the Peninsula.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/d\/a\/6\/600_366555782.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>DRIVING INSTRUCTIONS: The 55 Freeway turns into Newport Boulevard, which turns into Balboa Boulevard. &nbsp;Within the City of Newport Beach, take Balboa Boulevard down Balboa Peninsula to 15th Street. Parking is street side, along 15th Street and Balboa Blvd. After 6 PM, the metered parking is free. Be at the Post around 6 PM to provide ample time to locate street parking and walk to the Post entry.<\/p>\n<p>MEETING LOCATION: We meet at the American Legion Post entry that fronts on 15th Street on Balboa Peninsula in the city of Newport Beach.

The trail has a few small hills, but is mostly gently sloped -suitable for both beginner and advanced hikers. We take a short rest stop at Salt Creek Beach with rest room and drinking fountain facilities.... and return along the same route to our Meetup parking area. As an ongoing tradition of this event, many hikers following the hike enjoy the Taco Tuesday dinner special (two dollar tacos and two dollar Coronas) at Amber's Cantina located in our Meetup parking area. As another alternative during the summer months, other hikers may choose to extend the rest stop described above by bringing a potluck picnic to ocean front tables located in a park setting at Salt Creek Beach.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/5\/2\/600_381083122.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> GENERAL RATING\/DIFFICULTY: Advanced beginner (moderate) for distance, elevation and pace.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/a\/a\/600_381152682.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> DRIVING DIRECTIONS: From the 5 Freeway, take the Crown Valley Parkway exit toward the coast. Approximately one mile south of the Laguna Niguel town center, turn left on Club House Drive. At the south west corner of Niguel Road and Club House Drive, turn into the retail center. Look for the Meetup gathering in the parking area that fronts Fratello's Restaurant and Amber's Cantina. Please plan to arrive ten minutes early to provide time for a brief orientation and introductions.<\/p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL NOTES: Regular walking shoes, not hiking boots, are appropriate as this is a paved trail. As day light becomes shorter, a flashlight may be helpful.

This group originated from a close knit class of women who have been developing and practicing their talents for a number of years. We were brought together by Spirit and have continued to touch each other’s lives. When we first came together it had been predicted that each one of us would grow and advance in her talents and then continue expanding into the Universe. All were to be the light, teaching and guiding as she moved through this world. I am happy to say that I have personally watched as this prediction has come true. The talent that has been produced from this group has been truly amazing and the blessings for each one of us continues to grow. We have been there and supported each other through the worst and best of times and now have heard the message to share with others our gifts.<br> You have been invited to learn, practice and play your craft with us. All levels are welcomed. We offer you our friendship and support with like-minded people. Our plan is to meet once a month. Our favorite hang out for this fun get together is Fuzzy’s Taco Shop in Lewisville. Bring your favorite deck of cards or other divining tool for a fun and entertaining get together. This is an open group and we accept all levels of talent. Come and play and learn from some of the most talented intuitives and spiritual teachers in the DFW area!<\/p>","name":"Daughters of Delphi","group":{"id":14167462,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/2\/6\/600_433112038.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/2\/6\/highres_433112038.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/2\/6\/thumb_433112038.jpeg","photo_id":433112038},"group_lat":33.03,"name":"The Pleiadian School of Learning","state":"TX","group_lon":-97.07,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"The-Pleiadian-School-of-Learning","country":"us","city":"Flower Mound"}}

If your interested in participating RSVP as usual. Nadia Stewart, Video Journalist with Global News will be present (like a fly on the wall). This is a free event. Thank you for contributing to Cuddle Party awareness and to the further benefit of others. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Cuddle Party<\/b>&nbsp;is a fun and practical workshop about human connection and consensual non-sexual touch (think hand or shoulder massage, sharing hugs and snuggles, spooning). One decides with whom and how to cuddle, including to option to not cuddle at all. One may simply appreciate meeting others or having time to unwind. &nbsp;Some people are comfortable with touch, right away. Others explore the communication&nbsp;skills. While others are openly curious. Whatever your reasons, Cuddle Party is a great playground for practicing being true to oneself and connecting with other cuddly souls.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><b>Curious?<\/b>&nbsp;There's more . .<\/p> \n<p>In the first forty-five minutes participants are led through a series of playful exercises by a trained facilitator which allow for getting acquainted, assertive communication, and to learn the Cuddle Party rules (for e.g., tears and laughter are both welcome). Then for the next couple of hours you may practice the skills you've just learned, fill your cuddle tank&nbsp;or simply chit-chat, journal, rest. There are no cuddle or social expectations, just a willingness to&nbsp;<b>self-discover<\/b>.<\/p> \n<p><b>All genders<\/b><span>&nbsp;are welcome and ratio varies&nbsp;(and&nbsp;participants cuddle in variety - women and men cuddle, women cuddle women, also men cuddle men - in pairs and often in clusters&nbsp;of three, four, five, six - whatever one's comfortable with).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For those who feel most&nbsp;at ease&nbsp;in a smaller group, I keep it to&nbsp;<b>10-20<\/b>&nbsp;cuddlers&nbsp;(and for a variety of reasons, I keep a hard copy attendee&nbsp;list&nbsp;and overbook&nbsp;so the&nbsp;meetup&nbsp;RSVP&nbsp;total may vary from the true count).&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Bring along a&nbsp;<b>friend<\/b>.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This is an&nbsp;<b>alcohol-free\/smoke<\/b>-free&nbsp;event.<\/p>\n<p>You must be&nbsp;<b>18+<\/b>&nbsp;to participate.<\/p>\n<p>Wondering what to&nbsp;<b>wear<\/b>?

It is the tallest single-drop waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains. The water flows through a long gorge with cliffs up to 400 ft high (120 m), characteristic of the area's gorges that give rise to the common \"Ithaca is Gorges\" bumper stickers and t-shirts. The waterfall and gorge comprise an example of a hanging valley that developed in a very similar fashion to the one at nearby Watkins Glen State Park. None of the local gorges were \"carved by glaciers.\" In fact all of the gorges are post-glacial valleys carved by the streams that still run through them. It is the valleys over which the waterfalls hang that were eroded (over-deepened) by the advance of the Pleistocene ice sheets.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/6\/2\/600_434959554.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Cost: Free<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/0\/f\/600_434960239.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Attractions:<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Swimming is available only in designated life guarded area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Bikes are not permitted on the hiking trails but there is a bike path just outside the park.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/c\/1\/600_434960161.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Picnic areas have tables and fireplaces.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/d\/600_434961629.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Hot Showers and flush toilets are available.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/9\/e\/600_434960638.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;There is a concession stand.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Picnic shelters are on the premises.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Permitted activities are posted in park office.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;The park offers summer music concerts.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;There is Fishing in the creek and the lake.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Boat rentals are available.<\/p> \n<p>Maps:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/7\/3\/600_434960851.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Difficulty: Easy<\/p> \n<p>Distance:&nbsp;3.5 Miles<\/p> \n<p>Duration:&nbsp;5 Hours<\/p> \n<p>Suggested Car Pool Cost: $30<\/p> \n<p>Designated driver and passengers link:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Event Guide: <\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;At the parking lot we start our hike to Taughannock Falls using the north rim trail heading west for 1.5 miles.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/2\/3\/600_434961795.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Now we head east using the south rim trail for 1.08 miles.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/4\/6\/600_434961830.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Now we are down by the river using gorge trail heading west to Taughannock Falls.<\/p> \n<p>Reference Link:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fingerlakes.com\/parks\/taughannock-falls-state-park\">http:\/\/www.fingerlakes.com\/parks\/taughannock-falls-state-park<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nysparks.com\">http:\/\/nysparks.com<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/taughannock.com\/\">http:\/\/taughannock.com\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p>Disclaimer:<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asians-Meetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asians-Meetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p>END<\/p>","name":"Vibrant Embrace of Taughannock Falls","group":{"id":18338455,"category":{"id":16,"name":"language\/ethnic identity","shortname":"language"},"group_lat":40.77,"name":"20s & Up Asians-Meetup","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.96,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Asians-Meetup","country":"us","city":"New York"}}

It is the tallest single-drop waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains. The water flows through a long gorge with cliffs up to 400 ft high (120 m), characteristic of the area's gorges that give rise to the common \"Ithaca is Gorges\" bumper stickers and t-shirts. The waterfall and gorge comprise an example of a hanging valley that developed in a very similar fashion to the one at nearby Watkins Glen State Park. None of the local gorges were \"carved by glaciers.\" In fact all of the gorges are post-glacial valleys carved by the streams that still run through them. It is the valleys over which the waterfalls hang that were eroded (over-deepened) by the advance of the Pleistocene ice sheets.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/6\/2\/600_434959554.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Cost: Free<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/0\/f\/600_434960239.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Attractions:<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Swimming is available only in designated life guarded area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Bikes are not permitted on the hiking trails but there is a bike path just outside the park.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/c\/1\/600_434960161.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Picnic areas have tables and fireplaces.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/d\/600_434961629.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Hot Showers and flush toilets are available.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/9\/e\/600_434960638.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;There is a concession stand.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Picnic shelters are on the premises.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Permitted activities are posted in park office.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;The park offers summer music concerts.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;There is Fishing in the creek and the lake.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Boat rentals are available.<\/p> \n<p>Maps:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/7\/3\/600_434960851.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Difficulty: Easy<\/p> \n<p>Distance:&nbsp;3.5 Miles<\/p> \n<p>Duration:&nbsp;5 Hours<\/p> \n<p>Suggested Car Pool Cost: $30<\/p> \n<p>Designated driver and passengers link:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Event Guide: <\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;At the parking lot we start our hike to Taughannock Falls using the north rim trail heading west for 1.5 miles.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/2\/3\/600_434961795.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Now we head east using the south rim trail for 1.08 miles.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/4\/6\/600_434961830.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Now we are down by the river using gorge trail heading west to Taughannock Falls.<\/p> \n<p>Reference Link:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fingerlakes.com\/parks\/taughannock-falls-state-park\">http:\/\/www.fingerlakes.com\/parks\/taughannock-falls-state-park<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nysparks.com\">http:\/\/nysparks.com<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/taughannock.com\/\">http:\/\/taughannock.com\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p>Disclaimer:<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asians-Meetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asians-Meetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p>END<\/p>","name":"Vibrant Embrace of Taughannock Falls","group":{"id":18338455,"category":{"id":16,"name":"language\/ethnic identity","shortname":"language"},"group_lat":40.77,"name":"20s & Up Asians-Meetup","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.96,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Asians-Meetup","country":"us","city":"New York"}}

What’s up people?!?! The UFC will be just about as close as they can get to NYC with an awesome awesome card of fights. I don’t know about you guys\/gals but I have been very interested in seeing a UFC fight live and up close and personal and this will be one of the best opportunities yet! On April 18th in Newark NJ we will be preparing to see a monster card of killers featuring Luke Rockhold Vs. Lyoto Machida headlining what looks to be a promising under and main card of fights. We got Souza vs. Romero, Felice Herrig Vs. new comer (and strawweight hated) Paige Vanzant, Ovince Saint Preux Vs. Pat Cummins, Jim Miller Vs. the Undefeated Paul Felder and so much more! This fight is on BIG FOX so you know it’s going to be crazy in and outside of the arena. <\/p>\n<p>As it stands right now tickets are as low as $65 for nose bleed seats and go up to $1500+ for near cage side action. We would love to get everyone seated together if possible but we understand that everyone has a different price that they are willing to pay for this venue and card. I personally am willing to go as high as $200+ for this event but that may be too much for some to keep us all in a group together. <b>I propose for those that are going to go to suggest a price that they are willing to pay in the comments.<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/centernewark.com\/Tickets-Active.php?eventID=1722981&amp;venueID=5188\">Look up the available seats<\/a> in that range and let’s see if we can get a group of us to sit together. Even if we can’t sit together I would love to meet up at the event to say what’s up and share in the excitement of being there! Tickets are selling fast for this so if you are going I would say to make your suggestions and purchases ASAP. For those interested we can all try to meet and head to the event together if feasible. <\/p>\n<p>To top all of this off we will also have a local event for the home team. Look out for that announcement coming soon and look for us on the TV screen in the crowd at the event. It will be a HELLOVATIME either way! So who’s in?!!!?!<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;<i><b>P.S<\/b><\/i>.

Our family has supplied northern California with wine for over a century, surviving Prohibition in the 1920s by selling home winemaking kits.<\/p> \n<p>Louis Foppiano is 4th generation and grew up in the winemaking business. Over the years, Louis has worked in just about every position at the winery: driving the tractor in the vineyards; working the bottling line, crush pad and fermenting tanks; and, later after graduating from college, representing the winery around the world through sales and marketing.<\/p> \n<p>Like the three generations before him, Louis Foppiano has set the simple goal of creating honest, consistent, high quality wines, which are meant to be enjoyed at the table with family and friends. Under his direction, Foppiano Vineyards has enjoyed great success, increased prosperity, and critical acclaim.<\/p> \n<p>ASSUMPTION OF RISK - WAIVER AGREEMENT <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/denverwine\/pages\/ASSUMPTION_OF_RISK_-_WAIVER_AGREEMENT\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/denverwine\/pages\/ASSUMPTION_OF_RISK_-_WAIVER_AGREEMENT<\/a><\/p>","name":" 90+ Pt Sonoma Patio Wine Party: Louis Foppiano@Warwick-Pl­­ayboy Twist!","group":{"id":719275,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/5\/600_17521573.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/5\/highres_17521573.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/5\/thumb_17521573.jpeg","photo_id":17521573},"group_lat":39.6,"name":"Going Places - Doing Things","state":"CO","group_lon":-105.13,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"going-places","country":"us","city":"Littleton"}}

What’s up people?!?! The UFC will be just about as close as they can get to NYC with an awesome awesome card of fights. I don’t know about you guys\/gals but I have been very interested in seeing a UFC fight live and up close and personal and this will be one of the best opportunities yet! On April 18th in Newark NJ we will be preparing to see a monster card of killers featuring Luke Rockhold Vs. Lyoto Machida headlining what looks to be a promising under and main card of fights. We got Souza vs. Romero, Felice Herrig Vs. new comer (and strawweight hated) Paige Vanzant, Ovince Saint Preux Vs. Pat Cummins, Jim Miller Vs. the Undefeated Paul Felder and so much more! This fight is on BIG FOX so you know it’s going to be crazy in and outside of the arena. <\/p>\n<p>As it stands right now tickets are as low as $65 for nose bleed seats and go up to $1500+ for near cage side action. We would love to get everyone seated together if possible but we understand that everyone has a different price that they are willing to pay for this venue and card. I personally am willing to go as high as $200+ for this event but that may be too much for some to keep us all in a group together. <b>I propose for those that are going to go to suggest a price that they are willing to pay in the comments.<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/centernewark.com\/Tickets-Active.php?eventID=1722981&amp;venueID=5188\">Look up the available seats<\/a> in that range and let’s see if we can get a group of us to sit together. Even if we can’t sit together I would love to meet up at the event to say what’s up and share in the excitement of being there! Tickets are selling fast for this so if you are going I would say to make your suggestions and purchases ASAP. For those interested we can all try to meet and head to the event together if feasible. <\/p>\n<p>To top all of this off we will also have a local event for the home team. Look out for that announcement coming soon and look for us on the TV screen in the crowd at the event. It will be a HELLOVATIME either way! So who’s in?!!!?!<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;<i><b>P.S<\/b><\/i>. For those that are driving let us know in the comments. Perhaps we can create a few car pools with the non drivers chipping in for gas and tolls.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/a\/2\/600_434995970.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sherdog.com\/fighter\/Lyoto-Machida-7513\">Luke Rockhold Vs.

It is the tallest single-drop waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains. The water flows through a long gorge with cliffs up to 400 ft high (120 m), characteristic of the area's gorges that give rise to the common \"Ithaca is Gorges\" bumper stickers and t-shirts. The waterfall and gorge comprise an example of a hanging valley that developed in a very similar fashion to the one at nearby Watkins Glen State Park. None of the local gorges were \"carved by glaciers.\" In fact all of the gorges are post-glacial valleys carved by the streams that still run through them. It is the valleys over which the waterfalls hang that were eroded (over-deepened) by the advance of the Pleistocene ice sheets.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/6\/2\/600_434959554.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cost:<\/strong> Free<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/0\/f\/600_434960239.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Attractions:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Swimming is available only in designated life guarded area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/7\/b\/600_434959323.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Bikes are not permitted on the hiking trails but there is a bike path just outside the park.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/c\/1\/600_434960161.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Picnic areas have tables and fireplaces.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/d\/600_434961629.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Hot Showers and flush toilets are available.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/9\/e\/600_434960638.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;There is a concession stand.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Picnic shelters are on the premises.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Permitted activities are posted in park office.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;The park offers summer music concerts.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;There is Fishing in the creek and the lake.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Boat rentals are available.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Maps:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/7\/3\/600_434960851.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> Easy<\/p> \n<p><strong>Distance:<\/strong>&nbsp;3.5 Miles<\/p> \n<p><strong>Duration:<\/strong>&nbsp;5 Hours<\/p> \n<p><strong>Suggested Car Pool Cost:<\/strong> TBA<\/p> \n<p><strong>Designated driver and passengers link:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><strong>Event Guide:<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;At the parking lot we start our hike to Taughannock Falls using the north rim trail heading west for 1.5 miles.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/2\/3\/600_434961795.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Now we head east using the south rim trail for 1.08 miles.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/4\/6\/600_434961830.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;Now we are down by the river using gorge trail heading west to Taughannock Falls.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Reference Link:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fingerlakes.com\/parks\/taughannock-falls-state-park\">http:\/\/www.fingerlakes.com\/parks\/taughannock-falls-state-park<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nysparks.com\">http:\/\/nysparks.com<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/taughannock.com\/\">http:\/\/taughannock.com\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p><strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asians-Meetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asians-Meetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p><strong>END<\/strong><\/p>","name":"Vibrant Embrace of Taughannock Falls","group":{"id":18338455,"category":{"id":16,"name":"language\/ethnic identity","shortname":"language"},"group_lat":40.77,"name":"20s & Up Asians-Meetup","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.96,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Asians-Meetup","country":"us","city":"New York"}}

This fascinating biopic focuses on Yves Saint Laurent<br>at the zenith of his celebrity and explores his relationships, neuroses, addictions and<br>insecurities. It is, appropriately, a true work of art and France’s entry in the 2015 Academy<br>Awards®.<br>The always charismatic Gaspard Ulliel delivers a compelling performance as the tortured<br>iconoclast, ably supported by Aymeline Valade and Léa Seydoux as his muses. However,<br>it is the performances of Louis Garrel as the preening model and Jérémie Renier as Pierre<br>Bergé that are the real stand-outs. Saint Laurent’s fall from grace and his subsequent<br>rise to fame are well known, but this fascinating film adds new layers to his story of<br>redemption.<br>The other stars of the film are the outstanding soundtrack, and, of course, the clothes –<br>be prepared for a continuous display of covetable garments that serve as a reminder of<br>the true genius behind the aloof façade of Saint Laurent.<\/p> \n<p>“Bertrand Bonello’s glossily intuitive vision is pure haute couture” - Variety<br><\/p>","mtime":1425795626516,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/alternativefilmclub\/events\/220914719\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"payment_required":"0","name":"French Film Festival drama - ' Saint Laurent' - Sunday March 8th 5.45pm - Verona","id":"220914719","time":1425797100000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"au","city":"Sydney","name":"The Sydney Alternative Films","group_lon":151.21,"id":4158992,"urlname":"alternativefilmclub","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/8\/c\/highres_176479852.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/8\/c\/600_176479852.jpeg","photo_id":176479852,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/8\/c\/thumb_176479852.jpeg"},"group_lat":-33.87},"status":"upcoming"}

It is the tallest single-drop waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains. The water flows through a long gorge with cliffs up to 400 ft high (120 m), characteristic of the area's gorges that give rise to the common \"Ithaca is Gorges\" bumper stickers and t-shirts. The waterfall and gorge comprise an example of a hanging valley that developed in a very similar fashion to the one at nearby Watkins Glen State Park. None of the local gorges were \"carved by glaciers.\" In fact all of the gorges are post-glacial valleys carved by the streams that still run through them.

Maria Milisavljevic won the prestigious German Kleist Award for Young Dramatists in 2013 for Abyss.

Seating is unallocated. I’ve placed a limit of 16 attendees on this event, to keep numbers manageable. Because of the limit, it’s essential that the people who RSVP do come – otherwise they’re excluding people who would have come.<\/p>\n<p>For that reason, don’t RSVP until you’ve bought a ticket (after first checking that this Meetup event isn’t already fully subscribed) and you’re certain you will be coming. You will need to <b>make a note in your RSVP with your order number<\/b>. If you forget to do that at the time, you will need add the missing details by re-RSVPing and entering them as soon as possible. If you don’t let me know, I’ll assume that you haven’t bought a ticket and aren’t yet sure if you’ll attend, and I will remove you from the RSVP list.<\/p>\n<p>The performance is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, with an interval. We will stay on to have drinks in the theatre cafe-bar after the performance. This event is for people who will be staying for drinks afterward. If you won’t be joining drinks, please don’t RSVP. Please contribute £1 on arrival (to help defray the approx. £120 per annum that Meetup charges to run a group) – thanks in advance.<\/p>\n<p>In the days immediately prior, I’ll circulate details of arrangements to meet before the performance.<\/p>","name":"Abyss – at the Arcola Theatre","group":{"id":2394561,"category":{"id":20,"name":"movies\/film","shortname":"movies-film"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/9\/600_50990521.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/9\/highres_50990521.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/9\/thumb_50990521.jpeg","photo_id":50990521},"group_lat":51.53,"name":"Islington & Hackney theatregoers & cinephiles","state":"17","group_lon":-0.11,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Islington-and-Hackney-theatregoers-and-cinephiles","country":"gb","city":"London"}}

I've found a home in old Puerto Vallarta, poised on the hill overlooking the famous Playa Los Muertos (of Night of the Iguana fame). We can have the place for nine nights, Friday April 10 through Sunday Apriel 19... airport pick up, drop off is included, along with maid service, breakfast fixings and food staples.<\/p> \n<p> The casa is traditional in design, with painted tile and stucco. It features a private garden, large patio, pool and a balcony for optimal sunset viewing. The home backs up to the jungle and is reached by funicular from street level. It has four bedrooms and 3.5 baths. The large master has an en suite bath, available for an extra $250.<\/p> \n<p> The kitchen is great, and will be stocked with wine, water, breakfast fixings and other food staples. We'll have the maid come in every other day or so.<\/p> \n<p> This vacation is all about convenience and lazy, sunny days... It's going to be a pretty unstructured trip. Though I'm thinking of primarily of the beach and pool (and blended margaritas, there are many activities available... snorkeling and eco tours of the jungle, spas and museums. The casa is 5 to 10 minutes walk from downtown so we can walk to the beach, to dinner, or to shop, though cabs are plentiful and affordable.<\/p> \n<p>The price for the trip is $1250 for nine nights, ground only. All activities are extra, though I'm happy to help making arrangements for snorkeling, spas, jungle tours, etc.<\/p> \n<p>We need to book this quickly, or we risk losing out. I do have a backup casa in mind with similar amenity and a few nice perks, but I hope we get this one!<\/p> \n<p>If you RSVP please send me a message to make arrangements!<\/p>","name":"Escape to Tropical Puerto Vallarta, 9 Nights for $1250.00","group":{"id":3112342,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/0\/600_86398832.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/0\/highres_86398832.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/0\/thumb_86398832.jpeg","photo_id":86398832},"group_lat":37.38,"name":"Bay Area Boomers Travel  Pal","state":"CA","group_lon":-122.02,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Bay-Area-BoomerTravel-Pal","country":"us","city":"Sunnyvale"}}

I've found a home in old Puerto Vallarta, poised on the hill overlooking the famous Playa Los Muertos (of Night of the Iguana fame). We can have the place for nine nights, Friday April 10 through Sunday Apriel 19... airport pick up, drop off is included, along with maid service, breakfast fixings and food staples.<\/p> \n<p>The casa is traditional in design, with painted tile and stucco. It features a private garden, large patio, pool and a balcony for optimal sunset viewing. The home backs up to the jungle and is reached by funicular from street level. It has four bedrooms and 3.5 baths. The large master has an en suite bath, available for an extra $250.<\/p> \n<p>The kitchen is great, and will be stocked with wine, water, breakfast fixings and other food staples. We'll have the maid come in every other day or so.<\/p> \n<p>This vacation is all about convenience and lazy, sunny days... It's going to be a pretty unstructured trip. Though I'm thinking of primarily of the beach and pool (and blended margaritas, there are many activities available... snorkeling and eco tours of the jungle, spas and museums. The casa is 5 to 10 minutes walk from downtown so we can walk to the beach, to dinner, or to shop, though cabs are plentiful and affordable.<\/p> \n<p>The price for the trip is $1550 for nine nights, ground only. All activities are extra, though I'm happy to help making arrangements for snorkeling, spas, jungle tours, etc.<\/p> \n<p>We need to book this quickly, or we risk losing out. I do have a backup casa in mind with similar amenity and a few nice perks, but I hope we get this one!<\/p> \n<p>If you RSVP please send me a message to make arrangements!<\/p>","name":"Escape to Tropical Puerto Vallarta, 9 Nights for $1550.00","group":{"id":3112342,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/0\/600_86398832.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/0\/highres_86398832.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/0\/thumb_86398832.jpeg","photo_id":86398832},"group_lat":37.38,"name":"Bay Area Boomers Travel  Pal","state":"CA","group_lon":-122.02,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Bay-Area-BoomerTravel-Pal","country":"us","city":"Sunnyvale"}}

We've managed to privately reserve both the very large 'back-hall' and 'side-bar' just for our group. The live DJ will start at approximately 9:30pm. However, as there are two sections to our reserved area, the DJ will only be playing in one section (the back hall). &nbsp;The other reserved section, the 'side-bar', will only have low-volume music so it's more suitable for conversation.<\/p> \n<p> Our 250+ capacity privately reserved areas will be separate from the venue's additional sports bar (which incidentally was recently awarded the title of 'Best Sports Bar in Great Britain'). But there'll be no sport showing in our area :-)<\/p> \n<p> The venue closes at 1am. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We highly recommend new members arrive as close to the start as possible, ideally by 8.15pm.&nbsp;At this time it's much easier to introduce new members to the group, before most members start arriving. The event hosts (Martyn + Terry ) will be in our reserved area waiting to greet new members. In the unlikely event that we don't see you first, please ask members or staff for the event hosts as it's important that members are welcomed to the group.&nbsp;(we'll be holding white attendance sheets and wearing Meetup badges).<br><\/p> \n<p> Please scroll down to view a photograph of just a part of our reserved area in the 'back hall'. There's also a photograph of the pub and the adjoining West Kensington Tube Station. Turn right out of West Kensington Tube Station (there is only one exit) to reach the pub which is located in the next building along.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you have any queries then please do not hesitate to contact us.

Join me for another opportunity to see and support small regional theater groups at a reasonable price. The Campbell Theater in Martinez is putting on “The Foursome”. The Campbell Theater is located in Downtown Martinez and the tickets are $18.00 each at the theater or $9.00 each plus service charge on GoldStar. I have chosen the March 14,[masked]:00pm show. The theater is general admission, first come, first choice, no reserved seats, so if we want to sit together we should all enter at the same time.

As they play the course and compare their accomplishments, the members of&nbsp;The Foursome&nbsp;boast and bust each others' balls easily enough. But soon, the cracks begin to show, and real truths start to emerge. Well-reviewed for its wit and insight into men and middle age, the play was written by acclaimed Canadian playwright Norm Foster.<\/p> \n<p>Pay at the door on Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 7:30pm or purchase your tickets on Goldstar for $9.00 plus a service charge.<\/p>\n<p>Martinez Campbell Theater 636 Ward Street, Martinez, CA<\/p>\n<br>","name":"Let's Do & See \"The Foursome\"","group":{"id":3524362,"category":{"id":30,"name":"singles","shortname":"singles"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/5\/600_434703717.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/5\/highres_434703717.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/5\/thumb_434703717.jpeg","photo_id":434703717},"group_lat":37.9,"name":"~ East Bay Over 40 Singles ~","state":"CA","group_lon":-122.05,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"East-Bay-Over-Forty-Singles","country":"us","city":"Walnut Creek"}}

Eckhart<br> Tolle  calls The Work of Byron Katie® \"a<br> great blessing for our planet.\" Here's an opportunity to experience<br> the profoundly simple 4 question inquiry process that noted author<br> Wayne W. Dyer says \"has been enormously helpful to me personally.\"<br> Find out for yourself at this exciting new Westside venue and once<br> monthly event. A great workshop for anyone drawn to<br> Self-Improvement, Personal Inquiry, Spirituality and<br> Transformation: An Introduction to 'The Work of Byron Katie®' ~<br> Hanna Levinson presents and facilitates in West Los Angeles<br> (every 2nd Tuesday) at 7:00pm @ The Gateway \/ a Portal for<br> Growth &amp; Wellness, 2511 S. Barrington Ave, Suite 100, Rm III<br> (2nd floor by elevator\/stairs). The Gateway is at the NW Corner of<br> Gateway Blvd. &amp; Barrington Ave. (www.mapquest.com) Requested<br> Donation is $20 per person or $35 per couple. To confirm<br> attendance and reserve space(s), please contact Tony or Heidi at<br> The Gateway[masked] or call Hanna at[masked]-1778. For<br> questions about The Work, call Hanna directly or call Jeff Jones at<br>[masked] cell or[masked]-2923. This is not a training or a<br> belief system. It is more akin to engaging from your heart in an<br> active cognitive meditation. Events like this can be a combination<br> of discussion, presentation, and activity, with elements of all<br> three but mostly are one-on-one with each participant and other<br> participants observing and providing feedback at the end of each<br> investigation. Individual sessions can often be emotionally<br> difficult, highly humorous, heart wrenching, heart-warming,<br> motivational and inspiring. Hanna Levinson* an active facilitator<br> of The Work since 1998, will facilitate each meeting inviting you<br> to investigate your most stressful thoughts and limiting beliefs<br> (for those willing to write them down and take a look) with 4<br> Questions and a Turnaround or two. Inquiry via The Work of Byron<br> Katie offers remarkable, measurable and palpable shifts by<br> answering the 4 Questions from a place of personal integrity and<br> being present to the current experience (in Tolle speak: being in<br> the now of our lives). *Hanna Levinson, www.truthpoint.net<br> ([masked])[masked], attended The first European<br> Certification Training Program for the Work of Byron Katie® in<br> 1999 in Amsterdam and started the first Westside Work group in<br> Santa Monica, CA in 1998 shortly after experiencing The Work. The<br> Santa Monica group was ongong from 1998 through 2004 with Hanna as<br> its main facilitator and continued in Santa Monica with Jeff Jones<br> from 2004-2008. Jeff left Santa Monica in 2006 and expanded Inquiry<br> into Sierra Madre and the Pasadena area on the East side of LA to<br> Venice in the Marina del Rey area on the West side. Hanna<br> facilitates at least once a month and meets privately with<br> individuals and groups upon request.

This hike along scenic Cold Spring Creek has been a traditional trek for families.<\/p> \n<p>The hike begins at the Sherwood Trailhead. From the large parking area, walk through the woods toward the roaring East Fork of the Hood River to find the trail, where it crosses the raging stream on a massive, new log bridge (installed in 2007 after floods removed the former bridge). Turn right after crossing the bridge, and follow the East Fork Trail (no. 650) north as it gradually climbs high above the river and highway. At the half-mile mark, pass a viewpoint and round the corner into Cold Spring Creek canyon. The trail drops gently, and soon reaches the East Fork-Tamanawas Falls Trail Junction, where you head straight (left) toward a bridge over Cold Spring Creek. The continuation of the East Fork Trail heads north (right), and is an alternate route to the falls from the Polallie Trailhead.<\/p> \n<p>After crossing the creek, the trail ambles upstream, always within sight of the rushing stream, which tumbles over a series of tiny waterfalls. At 1.5 miles beginning climbing above the creek on a section of new trail. Pass the signed Tamanawas Falls-Tamanawas Falls Tie Trail Junction on the right, and then pass a second unsigned junction for the same trail (#650B). Continue on to Tamanawas Falls, crossing the upper reach of the large rock fall for a quarter mile. Beyond the rock fall, the trail enters forest, and soon arrives at a fine view upstream to Tamanawas Falls, at the 2 mile mark. From here, you can simply enjoy the falls from the trail, or follow one of the use paths for a closer look. Sure-footed hikers can climb the talus to the right of the falls to reach the amphitheater behind the falls.<\/p>","name":"Tamanawas Falls Hike","group":{"id":15557842,"category":{"id":23,"name":"outdoors\/adventure","shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/600_433277309.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/highres_433277309.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/thumb_433277309.jpeg","photo_id":433277309},"group_lat":45.5,"name":"Portland Outdoor Enthusiasts","state":"OR","group_lon":-122.69,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Portland-Outdoor","country":"us","city":"Portland"}}

This hike along scenic Cold Spring Creek has been a traditional trek for families.<\/p>\n<p>The hike begins at the Sherwood Trailhead. From the large parking area, walk through the woods toward the roaring East Fork of the Hood River to find the trail, where it crosses the raging stream on a massive, new log bridge (installed in 2007 after floods removed the former bridge). Turn right after crossing the bridge, and follow the East Fork Trail (no. 650) north as it gradually climbs high above the river and highway. At the half-mile mark, pass a viewpoint and round the corner into Cold Spring Creek canyon. The trail drops gently, and soon reaches the East Fork-Tamanawas Falls Trail Junction, where you head straight (left) toward a bridge over Cold Spring Creek. The continuation of the East Fork Trail heads north (right), and is an alternate route to the falls from the Polallie Trailhead.<\/p>\n<p>After crossing the creek, the trail ambles upstream, always within sight of the rushing stream, which tumbles over a series of tiny waterfalls. At 1.5 miles beginning climbing above the creek on a section of new trail. Pass the signed Tamanawas Falls-Tamanawas Falls Tie Trail Junction on the right, and then pass a second unsigned junction for the same trail (#650B). Continue on to Tamanawas Falls, crossing the upper reach of the large rock fall for a quarter mile. Beyond the rock fall, the trail enters forest, and soon arrives at a fine view upstream to Tamanawas Falls, at the 2 mile mark. From here, you can simply enjoy the falls from the trail, or follow one of the use paths for a closer look. Sure-footed hikers can climb the talus to the right of the falls to reach the amphitheater behind the falls.<\/p>","name":"Tamanawas Falls Hike","group":{"id":15557842,"category":{"id":23,"name":"outdoors\/adventure","shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/600_433277309.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/highres_433277309.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/thumb_433277309.jpeg","photo_id":433277309},"group_lat":45.5,"name":"Portland Outdoor Enthusiasts","state":"OR","group_lon":-122.69,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Portland-Outdoor","country":"us","city":"Portland"}}

I'm thinking 2 weekends before the weekend trip. We will do a 30 minutes Q'n A on what to bring and what's expected. Also we can check everyone's bike to be tip-top shape.<\/p> \n <p><b>Equipment must have list<\/b>: A capable mountain bike (is has to handle real mountain terrain), helmet, spare tube (even you ride tubeless), bike pump (1 per 4 riders), plenty of water, snack bar\/energy bar, back back, wear layers (mountain is a bit colder, in can we have to stop for a tire change). Bike tools. First aid kit (1 per 4 riders). <\/p> \n <p>Optional equipment: Gloves, eye protection, <b>bike lock <\/b>(stay over night or eating at a restaurant), bear propellant, Go-Pro, extra pair of socks (in case you step into the water!).<\/p> \n <p>We all stay in <b>one big group<\/b> to ensure everyone's safety. Rule #1, no one will be left behind; we start as a group, finish as a group. Rule #2, we go as fast as the slowest rider. <\/p> \n <p>We will stay in vocal communication range. (now I know why Dirt Diva's all got bike bells). The “train” will be mixed with different skilled riders so we can keep an eye on the “trail”. If anyone needs to stop or slow down for any reason, please yell “Stopping” and\/or ring your bell. This will ensure we stay together as a group. We will have skilled riders mixed with leading and sweeping. The trails I picked are pretty straight forward; however, it's real mountain biking, and faster riders will have to wait for us slower riders to catch up.<\/p> \n <p>If we split into<b> two groups<\/b>, same rule apply above, just with two different speed group. Remember folks, this trip is geared towards Beginners\/Intermediate Level riders. IT'S OK TO PUSH YOUR BIKE UP THE TRAIL. However, We will only split the groups up if the trail section is a steep climb, or a straight downhill. Stay with your speed group and communicate. The two groups will be just minutes apart and we will all meet up every 5 minutes to regroup.<\/p> \n <p>Let's have a awesome weekend trip and many more to come!<\/p> \n <p>Please have your bike in<b> tip-top shape <\/b>for this trip! I look forward to ride in the mountains when the weather warms up soon!<\/p> \n <p>Let me know if you have other great ideas or something I've overlooked!<\/p> \n <p> <br><\/p> \n<\/blockquote>","name":"Dupont Mountain Biking Weekend Trip for Beginners and Intermediate Levels","group":{"id":8568522,"category":{"id":23,"name":"outdoors\/adventure","shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/5\/3\/600_433579027.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/5\/3\/highres_433579027.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/5\/3\/thumb_433579027.jpeg","photo_id":433579027},"group_lat":35.1,"name":"Mountain Biking and Fun Activities Group!","state":"NC","group_lon":-81.02,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"North-Carolina-Mountain-Biking","country":"us","city":"Charlotte"}}

For this hike, avoid Road 15, that goes left (northwest). Instead, follow Road 20 that goes right (northeast). The road soon drops down to Catherine Creek as it bubbles through a small oak forest.<\/p> \n<p>About a quarter mile from the trailhead, near the creek, there's a road junction. The most-used path is now Road 21 which crosses Catherine Creek. There is a footbridge for hikers. Just before this, a road goes faintly left. Follow this faint road, which is the continuation of Road 20. Don't cross the creek.<\/p> \n<p>From here, the road goes along the west side of Catherine Creek, a ways above the creek. This road is passable by 4 wheel vehicles, so it makes an easy hiking trail.<\/p> \n<p>By mile 1.5 from the trailhead, when you reach another junction, you've gained 1000 feet of elevation. From here Road 20 goes left (west) out of the Catherine Creek drainage, over towards Coyote Wall and a fainter road continues north.<\/p> \n<p>The trail over to Coyote Wall uses an old 4 wheel drive road grade, which makes it an easy hiking trail, gradually sloped and wide. There are a lot of bicycles that use this. Someone cuts the branches and trees that fall across the road. This is not a solitude hike, but it's far enough from trailheads there aren't too many people. Keep a watch for bicycles that can sneak up behind you and startle you. This trail ends at the Coyote Wall Trail at mile 4.1 from the Catherine Creek Trailhead. Go west to get the splendid views from the basalt rim at the Coyote Wall Viewpoint. Return the way you came or try one of the variations listed below.<\/p> \n<p>At mile 1.7 is the high point of this hike at 1300 feet elevation. At mile 2.1 the trail crosses a stream. At mile 3.2 the trail crosses another stream. You could use these for drinking water, but in the late spring and summer they probably dry up. Between the two streams are several grassy ridges that go up and down from the trail. You can find many flat places you could pitch a tent at. It can get pretty windy here, so you might try to find the most protected place you can find.<\/p> \n<p>Past the second stream, the trail drops 400 feet down to Coyote Wall. There are several private residences above you. We will NOT be hiking the top of Coyote Wall, That is another long Hike Altogether.<\/p>","name":"Catherine Creek to Coyote Wall Hike - AFTERNOON HIKE","group":{"id":15557842,"category":{"id":23,"name":"outdoors\/adventure","shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/600_433277309.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/highres_433277309.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/thumb_433277309.jpeg","photo_id":433277309},"group_lat":45.5,"name":"Portland Outdoor Enthusiasts","state":"OR","group_lon":-122.69,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Portland-Outdoor","country":"us","city":"Portland"}}

There are great views of the Columbia River, the east end of the Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, and a lot of wildflowers.<\/p> \n<p>From the Catherine Creek Trailhead, there are two closed roads that go up from the parking area. For this hike, avoid Road 15, that goes left (northwest). Instead, follow Road 20 that goes right (northeast). The road soon drops down to Catherine Creek as it bubbles through a small oak forest.<\/p> \n<p>About a quarter mile from the trailhead, near the creek, there's a road junction. The most-used path is now Road 21 which crosses Catherine Creek. There is a footbridge for hikers. Just before this, a road goes faintly left. Follow this faint road, which is the continuation of Road 20. Don't cross the creek.<\/p> \n<p>From here, the road goes along the west side of Catherine Creek, a ways above the creek. This road is passable by 4 wheel vehicles, so it makes an easy hiking trail.<\/p> \n<p>By mile 1.5 from the trailhead, when you reach another junction, you've gained 1000 feet of elevation. From here Road 20 goes left (west) out of the Catherine Creek drainage, over towards Coyote Wall and a fainter road continues north.<\/p> \n<p>The trail over to Coyote Wall uses an old 4 wheel drive road grade, which makes it an easy hiking trail, gradually sloped and wide. There are a lot of bicycles that use this. Someone cuts the branches and trees that fall across the road. This is not a solitude hike, but it's far enough from trailheads there aren't too many people. Keep a watch for bicycles that can sneak up behind you and startle you. This trail ends at the Coyote Wall Trail at mile 4.1 from the Catherine Creek Trailhead. Go west to get the splendid views from the basalt rim at the Coyote Wall Viewpoint. Return the way you came or try one of the variations listed below.<\/p> \n<p>At mile 1.7 is the high point of this hike at 1300 feet elevation. At mile 2.1 the trail crosses a stream. At mile 3.2 the trail crosses another stream. You could use these for drinking water, but in the late spring and summer they probably dry up. Between the two streams are several grassy ridges that go up and down from the trail. You can find many flat places you could pitch a tent at.

There are great views of the Columbia River, the east end of the Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, and a lot of wildflowers.<\/p>\n<p>From the Catherine Creek Trailhead, there are two closed roads that go up from the parking area. For this hike, avoid Road 15, that goes left (northwest). Instead, follow Road 20 that goes right (northeast). The road soon drops down to Catherine Creek as it bubbles through a small oak forest.<\/p>\n<p>About a quarter mile from the trailhead, near the creek, there's a road junction. The most-used path is now Road 21 which crosses Catherine Creek. There is a footbridge for hikers. Just before this, a road goes faintly left. Follow this faint road, which is the continuation of Road 20. Don't cross the creek.<\/p>\n<p>From here, the road goes along the west side of Catherine Creek, a ways above the creek. This road is passable by 4 wheel vehicles, so it makes an easy hiking trail.<\/p>\n<p>By mile 1.5 from the trailhead, when you reach another junction, you've gained 1000 feet of elevation. From here Road 20 goes left (west) out of the Catherine Creek drainage, over towards Coyote Wall and a fainter road continues north.<\/p>\n<p>The trail over to Coyote Wall uses an old 4 wheel drive road grade, which makes it an easy hiking trail, gradually sloped and wide. There are a lot of bicycles that use this. Someone cuts the branches and trees that fall across the road. This is not a solitude hike, but it's far enough from trailheads there aren't too many people. Keep a watch for bicycles that can sneak up behind you and startle you. This trail ends at the Coyote Wall Trail at mile 4.1 from the Catherine Creek Trailhead. Go west to get the splendid views from the basalt rim at the Coyote Wall Viewpoint. Return the way you came or try one of the variations listed below.<\/p>\n<p>At mile 1.7 is the high point of this hike at 1300 feet elevation. At mile 2.1 the trail crosses a stream. At mile 3.2 the trail crosses another stream. You could use these for drinking water, but in the late spring and summer they probably dry up. Between the two streams are several grassy ridges that go up and down from the trail. You can find many flat places you could pitch a tent at. It can get pretty windy here, so you might try to find the most protected place you can find.<\/p>\n<p>Past the second stream, the trail drops 400 feet down to Coyote Wall. There are several private residences above you. We will NOT be hiking the top of Coyote Wall, That is another long Hike Altogether.<\/p>","name":"Catherine Creek to Coyote Wall Hike - AFTERNOON HIKE","group":{"id":15557842,"category":{"id":23,"name":"outdoors\/adventure","shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/600_433277309.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/highres_433277309.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/9\/d\/thumb_433277309.jpeg","photo_id":433277309},"group_lat":45.5,"name":"Portland Outdoor Enthusiasts","state":"OR","group_lon":-122.69,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Portland-Outdoor","country":"us","city":"Portland"}}

This hike along scenic Cold Spring Creek has been a traditional trek for families.<\/p> \n<p>The hike begins at the Sherwood Trailhead. From the large parking area, walk through the woods toward the roaring East Fork of the Hood River to find the trail, where it crosses the raging stream on a massive, new log bridge (installed in 2007 after floods removed the former bridge). Turn right after crossing the bridge, and follow the East Fork Trail (no. 650) north as it gradually climbs high above the river and highway. At the half-mile mark, pass a viewpoint and round the corner into Cold Spring Creek canyon. The trail drops gently, and soon reaches the East Fork-Tamanawas Falls Trail Junction, where you head straight (left) toward a bridge over Cold Spring Creek. The continuation of the East Fork Trail heads north (right), and is an alternate route to the falls from the Polallie Trailhead.<\/p> \n<p>After crossing the creek, the trail ambles upstream, always within sight of the rushing stream, which tumbles over a series of tiny waterfalls. At 1.5 miles beginning climbing above the creek on a section of new trail. Pass the signed Tamanawas Falls-Tamanawas Falls Tie Trail Junction on the right, and then pass a second unsigned junction for the same trail (#650B). Continue on to Tamanawas Falls, crossing the upper reach of the large rock fall for a quarter mile.

This hike along scenic Cold Spring Creek has been a traditional trek for families.<\/p>\n<p>The hike begins at the Sherwood Trailhead. From the large parking area, walk through the woods toward the roaring East Fork of the Hood River to find the trail, where it crosses the raging stream on a massive, new log bridge (installed in 2007 after floods removed the former bridge). Turn right after crossing the bridge, and follow the East Fork Trail (no. 650) north as it gradually climbs high above the river and highway. At the half-mile mark, pass a viewpoint and round the corner into Cold Spring Creek canyon. The trail drops gently, and soon reaches the East Fork-Tamanawas Falls Trail Junction, where you head straight (left) toward a bridge over Cold Spring Creek. The continuation of the East Fork Trail heads north (right), and is an alternate route to the falls from the Polallie Trailhead.<\/p>\n<p>After crossing the creek, the trail ambles upstream, always within sight of the rushing stream, which tumbles over a series of tiny waterfalls. At 1.5 miles beginning climbing above the creek on a section of new trail. Pass the signed Tamanawas Falls-Tamanawas Falls Tie Trail Junction on the right, and then pass a second unsigned junction for the same trail (#650B). Continue on to Tamanawas Falls, crossing the upper reach of the large rock fall for a quarter mile. Beyond the rock fall, the trail enters forest, and soon arrives at a fine view upstream to Tamanawas Falls, at the 2 mile mark. From here, you can simply enjoy the falls from the trail, or follow one of the use paths for a closer look.

There are great views of the Columbia River, the east end of the Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, and a lot of wildflowers.<\/p> \n<p>From the Catherine Creek Trailhead, there are two closed roads that go up from the parking area. For this hike, avoid Road 15, that goes left (northwest). Instead, follow Road 20 that goes right (northeast). The road soon drops down to Catherine Creek as it bubbles through a small oak forest.<\/p> \n<p>About a quarter mile from the trailhead, near the creek, there's a road junction. The most-used path is now Road 21 which crosses Catherine Creek. There is a footbridge for hikers. Just before this, a road goes faintly left. Follow this faint road, which is the continuation of Road 20. Don't cross the creek.<\/p> \n<p>From here, the road goes along the west side of Catherine Creek, a ways above the creek. This road is passable by 4 wheel vehicles, so it makes an easy hiking trail.<\/p> \n<p>By mile 1.5 from the trailhead, when you reach another junction, you've gained 1000 feet of elevation. From here Road 20 goes left (west) out of the Catherine Creek drainage, over towards Coyote Wall and a fainter road continues north.<\/p> \n<p>The trail over to Coyote Wall uses an old 4 wheel drive road grade, which makes it an easy hiking trail, gradually sloped and wide. There are a lot of bicycles that use this. Someone cuts the branches and trees that fall across the road. This is not a solitude hike, but it's far enough from trailheads there aren't too many people. Keep a watch for bicycles that can sneak up behind you and startle you. This trail ends at the Coyote Wall Trail at mile 4.1 from the Catherine Creek Trailhead. Go west to get the splendid views from the basalt rim at the Coyote Wall Viewpoint. Return the way you came or try one of the variations listed below.<\/p> \n<p>At mile 1.7 is the high point of this hike at 1300 feet elevation. At mile 2.1 the trail crosses a stream. At mile 3.2 the trail crosses another stream. You could use these for drinking water, but in the late spring and summer they probably dry up. Between the two streams are several grassy ridges that go up and down from the trail. You can find many flat places you could pitch a tent at.
