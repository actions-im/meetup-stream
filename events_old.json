Since many members of this Meetup are from the Roanoke area, I thought I would change things up and schedule an event in Roanoke. Also, since I have not met many of you, and am not aware of individual members level of exposure to Mark Passio's work, I thought it would be appropriate to introduce members to what Mark considers the foundational heart of his work. This is knowledge that has been hidden from the bulk of humanity for a very long time, and is knowledge which has been used by few to control the many. This is basically, ancient knowledge of how this world and the human mind operates. If we are to change present dire conditions for the better, more of us need to acquire and spread this knowledge.<\/p> \n<p>This seminar was professionally filmed and is on the whatonearthis happening.com web site to watch for oneself, but I feel that there is a lot to be gained by discussing the material, and it is a chance for individuals of similar mind to come together in fellowship. At this point in time, it is all too easy to feel isolated when attempting to bring up this type of material with family or friends. Let's help to change that.<\/p> \n<p>This venue has a large projector screen. tables, chairs, microwave, coffee maker, sink and refrigerator, as well as convenient rest rooms. Feel free to bring non-alcoholic drinks and snacks, and as many guests as you would like. They do not have to be members of the Meetup.

When talking about the concept of a mastermind partnership, he says \"no two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind\" and he refers to this \"third mind\" as a master mind. The main concept behind a mastermind group is that a group of people putting their knowledge and ideas together is much more powerful than a single person working alone.<\/p>\n<p><b>What's Next?<\/b> <\/p>\n<p>Does this description resonate with you?&nbsp; If it does, please RSVP and I will be in contact with you to see you would be a good fit for the group!<br><\/p>","name":"Women's Highly Sensitive Mastermind Group","group":{"id":18258171,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_lat":39.65,"name":"Denver Highly Sensitive People (HSP) Empowerment Group!","state":"CO","group_lon":-104.98,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"HSPDenver","country":"us","city":"Englewood"}}

One cannot enjoy the trail if it rains.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- we will be walking some parts on very slippery trails, so you need to have proper walking shoes\/equipement with you. And watch your steps!!!<\/p> \n<p>What you need during the walk:<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- enough time, no stress or rushing. I am planning to leave Merten around 5pm. The walk itself is about 16km in total and without breaks we need ca. 3,5 hours for that. It depends on the &nbsp;condition of the group and the number of breaks, if it takes less or longer than 5pm to hit&nbsp; the road back home. <br><\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- as mentioned before, proper walking shoes and equipement, enough water\/drinks and snacks, as we won't be stopping for a meal during the walk. The plan is to have &nbsp;just short stops in between for a little refreshement.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- good mood and some middle good condition. The trail itself is not very difficult, just few ups and downs (total ups - 211m; total downs - 285m) however with some &nbsp;great views ;)<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- some money for the ticket leaving from Bonn, Cologne, Troisdorf and, and, and...towards Merten and going back; optionally something for a drink after the hike.<\/p> \n<p>I will be leaving at 11:18am from Bonn Beuel Bahnhof, platform 2, arriving in Troisdorf at 11:27am to get the next train to Merten at 11:54am (S12 direction Au\/Sieg), arriving at 12:13pm in Merten.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;It is your decision, where you want to join the group. We will be starting the hike around 12:15pm from Merten Bahnhof. If you want to join me already in Bonn Beuel, be aware, that there is no ticket service at the station. You can buy your ticket only at the ticket machine.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>If you want to join the others on the group ticket, please be there around 11am, however I cannot &nbsp;guarantee any group tickets. I hope we will be having a great hike, with lots of sunshine and some happy folks.

A woman. A shelter. Two very different people trap themselves underground <br>on the eve of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and share only one connection; the mutual friend who tried to help them both. Against a backdrop of fear mongering&nbsp;and paranoia with illusions shattering and fingers being pointed, these two <br>deeply flawed humans must work together to survive; or tear each other apart. The enemy is everywhere, and the War is Cold. It is like hell. <br>&nbsp;PLUS<\/p>\n<p> Search Tower <\/p>\n<p> Company – My Film <br>A man with delusions of cinematic grandeur <br>recounts his sometimes beautiful, sometimes heartbreaking accounts of romance <br>while trying to understand for himself. <\/p>\n<p> <strong>Thursday March&nbsp; 26, 2015<\/strong> <br>Mudfoot Theatre – River River is an interdisciplinary performance inspired by David Thompson’s expeditions, <br>reimagined mythology and the Bow River. Using live music, an original composition, and animated objects, River explores the story of the Bow River, including its birth and its death.<\/p>\n<p> PLUS<\/p>\n<p>Peripheral Theatre Co. – Stag \/ Stagette <br>Kale attempts to recreate and reconcile his relationship <br>with Kara by recasting her. The new actress playing Kara has designs to seduce the actor playing Kale so that he will forget his old love. This proves to be a more difficult undertaking than she had imagined.&nbsp; <br>PLUS<\/p>\n<p>Russian Theatre Foundation – Interpretation <br>What happens when two people decide to <br>communicate their true feelings…. with the help of an interpreter. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Friday March 27, 2015<\/strong> <br>Tighty Whities – Smee’s Secret <br>Olive, Pistachio, and their trusty friend Smee find themselves in a strange new place full of sheets and mystery. As they acquaint themselves with their new surroundings, they discover that the biggest <br>mystery is Smee’s sudden decline in health. <br>PLUS<\/p>\n<p>Thumbs Up, Good Work – Hexen <br>HEXEN is about four witches and the men they’ve been sent to punish for crimes against the Earth and each other. The men who work closest to nature begin to notice strange occurrences around them - in the animals, rivers, <br>and hills. What they don’t realize is these signs have been sent as a warning from the witches on behalf of the nature that surrounds them. However, the enemy of the witches has his ways of encouraging the men to continue down their current path. Will they listen to their own humanity or reject it for the promise of something better? <br>PLUS<\/p>\n<p>Dragonfly Productions – Palaestra <br>This play is about Rome - the eternal city. It also delves <br>into the story of three individuals who found meaning in their lives by pursuing greatness beyond their own selves. The play begins with discerning the finite and the infinite, while determining man’s existence within these two realms. <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>Saturday March&nbsp; 28, 2015<\/strong> <br>Poor House Productions – A Pair of Falsies <br>Two viruses become trapped in the same cell. When one <br>is asked to save the world, he gets a lot more than he bargained for. And then he meets someone who hasn’t spoken for two million years. <\/p>\n<p> PLUS<\/p>\n<p>Kaboom Hooray – You Can’t Always Get What You Want <br>Ever since he was a child, Adolph has always seen the world in a different light – darkness. And in an insane universe filled with mad characters and even madder complications, he might just be right. The again, maybe there’s hope after all. Or maybe there isn’t.

The group provides a safe atmosphere where group members both give and receive support and feedback, and challenge and learn from one another.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of a mastermind group was first introduced by Napoleon Hill in his book \"Think and Grow Rich\". When talking about the concept of a mastermind partnership, he says \"no two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind\" and he refers to this \"third mind\" as a master mind. The main concept behind a mastermind group is that a group of people putting their knowledge and ideas together is much more powerful than a single person working alone.<\/p>\n<p><b>What's Next?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Does this description resonate with you?

The group provides a safe atmosphere where group members both give and receive support and feedback, and challenge and learn from one another.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of a mastermind group was first introduced by Napoleon Hill in his book \"Think and Grow Rich\". When talking about the concept of a mastermind partnership, he says \"no two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind\" and he refers to this \"third mind\" as a master mind. The main concept behind a mastermind group is that a group of people putting their knowledge and ideas together is much more powerful than a single person working alone.<\/p>\n<p><b>What's Next?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Does this description resonate with you?

It depends on the &nbsp;condition of the group and the number of breaks, if it takes less or longer than 5pm to hit&nbsp; the road back home. <br><\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- as mentioned before, proper walking shoes and equipement, enough water\/drinks and snacks, as we won't be stopping for a meal during the walk. The plan is to have &nbsp;just short stops in between for a little refreshement.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- good mood and some middle good condition. The trail itself is not very difficult, just few ups and downs (total ups - 211m; total downs - 285m) however with some &nbsp;great views ;)<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- some money for the ticket leaving from Bonn, Cologne, Troisdorf and, and, and...towards Merten and going back; optionally something for a drink after the hike.<\/p> \n<p>I will be leaving at 11:18am from Bonn Beuel Bahnhof, platform 2, arriving in Troisdorf at 11:27am to get the next train to Merten at 11:54am (S12 direction Au\/Sieg), arriving at 12:13pm in Merten.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;It is your decision, where you want to join the group. We will be starting the hike around 12:15pm from Merten Bahnhof. If you want to join me already in Bonn Beuel, be aware, that there is no ticket service at the station. You can buy your ticket only at the ticket machine.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>If you want to join the others on the group ticket, please be there around 11am, however I cannot &nbsp;guarantee any group tickets. I hope we will be having a great hike, with lots of sunshine and some happy folks. Hope to see you there ;) Cheers ;)<\/p>","name":"Hiking on the Siegsteig - 16k - castles, forrests, hills and the Sieg river","group":{"id":6989592,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/8\/600_210301352.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/8\/highres_210301352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/8\/thumb_210301352.jpeg","photo_id":210301352},"group_lat":50.73,"name":"Bonn Social","group_lon":7.1,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Bonn-Social","country":"de","city":"Bonn"}}

The days are pretty full, so the director suggested planning to stay a couple of extra days on each end. the $429 is for the writers conference itself, and covers breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lodging and airfare are not included, but if you go to their website and follow the lodging link, you'll find special rates for attendees. As of today (March 7, 2015), Cheapoair has tickets from Denver covering those days for less than $650.<\/p> \n<p>More details:<\/p> \n<p>The second annual Kauai Writers Conference (May 1-3, 2015) is filling fast. The 2015 Kauai Writers Conference focuses on fiction and memoir. The panels of presenters include bestselling authors, editors, and agents. We also offer a self- publishing and independent publishing track. Unlike many other conferences, including the former Maui Writers Conference, we are limiting attendance to just 150 writers, so the event stays intimate. Attendees can easily mix with the presenters and one another. Better yet, Kauai is one of the most beautiful places on the planet (next to Colorado, of course). You may receive a FREE MANUSCRIPT CRITIQUE with your conference registration if you sign up by March 15. Those who enroll and pay the full conference fee before March 15 are eligible to receive a free 10-page manuscript critique during the conference by either literary agent Elizabeth Kracht (Kimberly Cameron and Associates) or associate book editor Silissa Kenney (St. Martin's Press). The manuscript sample would be submitted in advance. This supportive feedback will focus on what you can do to make your manuscript salable. As of today, there are only SEVEN free critique slots available, which are filling fast on a first come, first served basis, so act now!

This player occasionally forces errors when serving. Rallies may be lost due to impatience. Teamwork in doubles is evident.<\/p>\n<p><a>4.5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player has begun to master the use of power and spins and is beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots, and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents.

Each noise a voice in itself, telling a story whether he wanted to hear it nor not, cascading from above, or rolling in from below. From all angles it came at him, tugging at his purposeful walk. Despite the shouts of angry patrons, or the cooing of false promises from the beauties he passed by, his feet kept him moving forward. The street lamps blanketed the sidewalk with their own cadence, as if he was walking across a chessboard. Trash cans stood as squat sentries, some overflowing with the debris of convenience, some with fire playing above the rim for a few seeking warmth. Puddles from the days rain were splashed at times by transporters whose passengers did not want to stop, but were still in search of something unspoken. The moon struggled to peak out around the shadowed clouds, hinting that the night was soon to be bathed in her fullness, even if the chill of darkness kept the body moving. <\/p>\n<p>He rounded the corner to find himself on Aramingo, or that's what it used to be called. His great-grandfather, affectionately called G-Papp, used to say that before the Great Change, the streets used to have metal signs that read with their name, and that people used cars or buses to get where they were going. His stories of traffic lights, pot holes, convenience stores, and the trappings of the Pre-Change culture seemed so far away. People used to walk and mingle on the streets as part of their daily lives, breathing the air without using a thelium tube. So strange to him! Breathing the air as it was, with no concern of a painful termination. To no such worries. It must have been quite an experience. <\/p>\n<p>His thoughts ended as approached the alley he knew well. A nondescript, typical entry way between sub domes, that was often shrouded by shadows of curving roofs. He was sure that while some things from the past were kept, much was abandoned to embrace the symmetry of the Ones. But alleys seemed to be harbor secrets, and this one held a special secret that not many knew of. Dropping his spare thelium tube on purpose, he bent to pick it up, making the signal with his thumb and forefinger. Within moments, a flash of light pierced out from the shadows of the alley, giving him clearance. He gave a cursory glance around him, knowing that for the next few seconds, the millions of cameras watching his every move would be hit with a few seconds of static, giving him enough time to step into the darkness and through the faux door that was opened for him. <\/p>\n<p>The only sound of the door closing was a faint bump, and then silence. The viso droids fluttered around him, scanning for any potential bugs or, as the old school term was called, a 'wire'. He wasn't worried, as he was a regular here, and they knew him. But familiarity did not mean access, and within moments he heard the beep of approval from the viso droids. <\/p>\n<p>Light spilled out in front of him as a second door opened up. He passed through, stepping out of the darkness and into the light, hearing then the voices of others who came here for the same purpose. It was a big crowd today, not the usual handful of people using their credits for a brief escape. He made sure he had a few extra vrillars to spend before walking over, allowing himself the luxury of options, something that he seldom had the chance to do. <\/p>\n<p>Placing his coat on a hook at his usual station, he sat before red screen he knew so well. He removed his thelium tube and placed it on the desk in front of him, and reamained still as the machine slowly encased him in what was affectionately called the pod.&nbsp; He felt his feet become secured to the floor, soon followed by his arms being locked down onto the arm rest, and then his head to the rest. The computer's voice then said \"Close your eyes, please,\" and he complied with out any fight. The machine felt a bit gruff to some, but he had long embraced the rigidity as a part of the process. <\/p>\n<p>\"Scanning thought waves,\" it said. A brief hum followed, which he called the tuning fork. It always reminded him of the nitrous gas one had to breath during implant process when he was young, when you didn't know enough to object to the mandated micro-chipping. You were old enough to know that something was going on, but too young to ask questions. But he learned to fix that problem later on, along with a few other things. He was one of the lucky ones. <\/p>\n<p>When the tuning fork was done, the machine's voice continued. <\/p>\n<p>\"Destination?\" <\/p>\n<p>\"Philadelphia,\" he responded. \"2015, April.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Stand by,\" it came back with. He could swear it sounded a slight bit agitated, but he often over thought such things. <\/p>\n<p>\"Pass code?\" it asked, sounding pleasantly inhuman but predictable. <\/p>\n<p>\"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux,\" he responded, as he felt the system begin the transport process. G-Papp always talked about how it was a life changing time for him, because he didn't have toys like this when he was young. He knew his great-grandfather, were he alive today, would be amazed at the ability to thought travel. He owed him everything, as G-Papp's DNA was in his blood too. That gave him access to so many experiences that he would otherwise never have. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Does not compute. Repeat,\" came the response. Damn, this unit didn't have a translator installed, he thought. But it didn't matter which model he had, as they all did the same job. You work with what you got. <\/p>\n<p>\"Hear, See, Sexy, Light,\" he responded. And that was it. The machine took over, placing his body in the usual temp stasis, while his mind was then taken back to a date that made history.<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/5\/e\/600_434973630.jpeg\"><br> <\/p>\n<br>","name":"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux","group":{"id":398123,"category":{"id":27,"name":"photography","shortname":"photography"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/600_434703216.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/highres_434703216.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/thumb_434703216.jpeg","photo_id":434703216},"group_lat":39.96,"name":"Philadelphia Glamour Photography Group","state":"PA","group_lon":-75.2,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"The-Philadelphia-Glamour-Photography-Group","country":"us","city":"Philadelphia"}}

This 200-hectare park occupies part of the mountain that lies in the midst of Montreal island, and includes the highest spot in the city (234m).<br> In the 1860s, mass cutting of trees on the mountain for firewood outraged the populace and led to the area’s designation as a park in 1876. It was originally landscaped by<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_Law_Olmsted\"><strong>Frederick Law Olmsted<\/strong><\/a><strong>, perhaps best known for New York City’s Central Park, although not all his proposed plans were eventually carried out.<br> The lookout facing over downtown towards the river was first built in 1906 and is now officially known as the Belvédère Kondiaronk, named for the Huron chief who signed a major peace accord with the French regime in 1701. A second lookout, a famous trysting spot, faces eastward toward the Olympic Stadium.<br> The Georges-Étienne Cartier monument on the Park Avenue side was inaugurated in 1919 and the illuminated cross in 1924. The lookout chalet (1932) and Beaver Lake (1938) were the fruit of work projects created to help workers left jobless by the Depression. In 1954, many trees were cut down to try to“discourage immorality” in the underbrush, which is why so few of the park’s trees are more than half a century old.<br> 1958 saw the addition of the Beaver Lake pavilion, a sweet bit of retro-futurist kitsch that functions as changing room in wintertime for skaters and tobogganers. This building has recently been renovated.<br> A major sculpture show was held in 1964 on the long gentle slope above Beaver Lake and some of the pieces are still in place.<br> Over the years, the perimeter of the park has been nibbled at by surrounding construction. Many trees also were lost to the January 1998 ice storm. Mount Royal was made a permanently protected site by a joint decision of the Quebec and Montreal governments in February 2003, and the demolition of the Park-Pine interchange has made access to the park easier from Park Avenue. But there is still stress on the park from surrounding institutions.<br> Mount Royal is where Montrealers go to get a breath of air on a hot day, to cross-country ski without leaving the city, to walk off a hangover or a bad mood, to picnic, to jog, to ice skate, to look out over the city, rest their eyes on the horizon and dream.<br> To get to Mount Royal park you only need to start up any hill from downtown and you’ll eventually find yourself there. A trail from the Cartier monument on the Park Avenue side (bus<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/bus\/PLAN_LIG\/A-PL80.htm\"><strong>80<\/strong><\/a> <strong>or<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/bus\/PLAN_LIG\/A-PL129.htm\"><strong>129<\/strong><\/a><strong>) winds gradually upward toward the top.

You can also drive up via Côte-des-Neiges and the Voie Camillien-Houde: there are various well-marked parking lots off the road.<br> Mount Royal shares the top of the mountain with several cemeteries: a huge Roman Catholic one, a large nondenominational one, and two quite small contiguous Jewish ones. Although not properly speaking parks, the<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cimetierenddn.org\/\"><strong>Notre-Dame-des-Neiges<\/strong><\/a><strong>and<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountroyalcem.com\/\"><strong>Mount Royal Cemetery<\/strong><\/a> <strong>can be pleasant places to stroll.

Mount Royal Park was officially opened on Queen Victoria’s birthday, Wednesday, May 24, 1876. The opening ceremony on the mountain was preceded by a parade through the streets of Montréal. The parade left from the post office on St. Jacques Street in old Montréal at 10 a.m. As reported in the Opinion Publique, a newspaper of the period, the procession set off in no particular order and stopped for a while on Bleury Street, where three volunteer regiments, escorted by their musical bands, momentarily blocked traffic. The procession then turned onto the newly paved St. Catherine Road and made its way to the summit of the mountain along the magnificent thoroughfare. Citizens came out to the mountain in their thousands to await the arrival of the parade and the inauguration ceremonies, laden with provisions for “a pantagruelic picnic seasoned with a great deal of gaiety,” according to the Opinion Publique. Speeches<br> A few minutes before noon, Dr. Wolfred Nelson, Councillor, and Chair of the Mount Royal Park Commission, invited the Mayor of Montréal, William H. Hingston, to open the day’s proceedings. But it was Mayor Aldis Bernard who had been the prime mover behind the creation of the park. At City Hall from 1873 to 1875, Aldis Bernard was nicknamed the mayor of parks. It was under his administration that three major park projects were undertaken. Besides Mount Royal Park, Montrealers were given two other public green spaces: Île Sainte-Hélène and Lafontaine Park (Logan farm). Shortly before Mayor Hingston ended his address, the four cannons of Colonel Stevenson’s battery fired the first salvo of the royal salute, which was responded to by the artillery of Île Sainte-Hélène. This was not the first time that Colonel Stevenson had fired his cannon from the mountain. In response to those who claimed that the mountain was inaccessible, he climbed Mount Royal with his battery twice, in 1862 and 1863, and fired the cannon from the summit. His gesture did not go unnoticed and Colonel Stevenson thus contributed in his own way to the creation of Mount Royal Park. The opening ceremony featured other speakers besides Councillor Nelson and Mayor Hingston. One of them was Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Mount Royal Park. This famous landscape architect, the creator of New York’s Central Park, had been mandated by the city of Montréal to plan the park. Olmsted wished to preserve the natural charm of the mountain. The winding path he laid out, which today bears his name, was designed to allow people to discover the beauty of this natural space. He wanted the park to be accessible to everyone, regardless of social class or physical condition. His wish was to be fulfilled. When the speeches ended, Colonel Stevenson began the hundred-gun salute marking the occasion. Mount Royal Park’s opening day would be fondly remembered by the thousands of Montrealers who attended the festivities. Frederick Law Olmsted Frederick Law Olmsted drew the design plans for Mount Royal Park in an age where he was considered the most famous landscape architect in North America. To appreciate Olmsted's work, one must keep in mind the era in which he lived. Olmsted lived from 1822 to 1903 and witnessed the transformation of North America from a rural and agricultural society to an urbanized and industrialized one. In 1800, only 10% of Americans lived in communities of over 1,000, but by 1910, 46% of the population lived in urban centres. In the 1830s, trains began to run in the United States. By 1840, there were 5,000 kilometres of track. In 1900, people and merchandise could travel on a network of 320,000 kilometres of railroad track. Social change did not occur without problems. In midlife, Olmsted began attempting to mitigate the upheavals of industrialization and urbanization through his work as a landscape architect. Before that, he had explored the world and worked at several trades in the fast-changing western world. Each of his experiences influenced his approach to landscape and nature. A descendant of founding pilgrims from New England, Olmsted was born in 1822 in Hartford to a family of merchants. His childhood was influenced by the landscapes of the Connecticut River, which he explored with his family. By the time he was 18, he had attended 13 different schools ranging from neighbourhood schools run by kindly gentlewomen to brutal boarding schools and strict religious institutions. His education was interspersed with salutary hiking trips through the countryside. He worked as a clerk in New York for two years before returning to Hartford at the age of 20. He then spent a year hiking, camping and sailing<br> <br> THE MEETUP UP WILL BE CANCELLED IF FREEZING RAIN OR SNOW STORM&nbsp; IS IN THE WEATHER FORECAST THE DAY OF EVENT.

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission , saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":1550259,"category":{"id":1,"name":"fine arts\/culture","shortname":"arts-culture"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/2\/3\/600_11596931.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/2\/3\/highres_11596931.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/2\/3\/thumb_11596931.jpeg","photo_id":11596931},"group_lat":40.69,"name":"~ CrEaTiveLy iNsPiRed by FlambOyant-dOTTEd moMenTs ~","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.38,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"CrEaTiveLy-iNsPiRed","country":"us","city":"Lindenhurst"}}

Can sustain a short rally of slow pace with other players of the same ability.<\/p> \n<p><a>3.0<\/a><\/p> \n<p>This player is fairly consistent when hitting medium paced shorts, but is not comfortable with all strokes and lacks execution when trying for directional control, depth, or power. Most common doubles formation is one-up, one-back.<\/p> \n<p><a>3.5<\/a><\/p> \n<p>This player has achieved improved stroke dependability with directional control on moderate shots, but still lacks depth and variety. This player exhibits more aggressive net play, has improved court coverage, and is developing teamwork in doubles.<\/p> \n<p><a>4.0<\/a><\/p> \n<p>This player has dependable strokes, including directional control and depth on both forehand and backhand sides on moderate shots, plus the ability to use lobs, overheads, approach shots and volleys with some success. This player occasionally forces errors when serving. Rallies may be lost due to impatience. Teamwork in doubles is evident.<\/p> \n<p><a>4.5<\/a><\/p> \n<p>This player has begun to master the use of power and spins and is beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots, and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents. This player can hit first serves with power and accuracy and place the second serve. This player tends to over hit on difficult shots. Aggressive net play is common in doubles.<\/p> \n<p><a>5.0<\/a><\/p> \n<p>This player has good shot anticipation and frequently has an outstanding shot or attribute around which a game may be structured. This player can regularly hit winners or force errors off of short balls and can put away volleys, can successfully execute lobs, drop shots, half volleys, overhead smashes, and has good depth and spin on most 2nd serves.<\/p> \n<p><a>5.5<\/a><\/p> \n<p>This player has developed power and\/or consistency as a major weapon. This player can vary strategies and styles of play in a competitive situation and hits dependable shots in a stress situation.<\/p> \n<p><a>6.0 to 7.0<\/a><\/p> \n<p>The 6.0 player typically has had intensive training for national tournament competition at the junior and collegiate levels and has obtained a sectional and\/or national ranking.

This 200-hectare park occupies part of the mountain that lies in the midst of Montreal island, and includes the highest spot in the city (234m). <br> In the 1860s, mass cutting of trees on the mountain for firewood outraged the populace and led to the area’s designation as a park in 1876. It was originally landscaped by <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_Law_Olmsted\"><strong>Frederick Law Olmsted<\/strong><\/a><strong>, perhaps best known for New York City’s Central Park, although not all his proposed plans were eventually carried out. <br> The lookout facing over downtown towards the river was first built in 1906 and is now officially known as the Belvédère Kondiaronk, named for the Huron chief who signed a major peace accord with the French regime in 1701. A second lookout, a famous trysting spot, faces eastward toward the Olympic Stadium. <br> The Georges-Étienne Cartier monument on the Park Avenue side was inaugurated in 1919 and the illuminated cross in 1924. The lookout chalet (1932) and Beaver Lake (1938) were the fruit of work projects created to help workers left jobless by the Depression. In 1954, many trees were cut down to try to“discourage immorality” in the underbrush, which is why so few of the park’s trees are more than half a century old. <br> 1958 saw the addition of the Beaver Lake pavilion, a sweet bit of retro-futurist kitsch that functions as changing room in wintertime for skaters and tobogganers. This building has recently been renovated. <br> A major sculpture show was held in 1964 on the long gentle slope above Beaver Lake and some of the pieces are still in place. <br> Over the years, the perimeter of the park has been nibbled at by surrounding construction. Many trees also were lost to the January 1998 ice storm. Mount Royal was made a permanently protected site by a joint decision of the Quebec and Montreal governments in February 2003, and the demolition of the Park-Pine interchange has made access to the park easier from Park Avenue. But there is still stress on the park from surrounding institutions. <br> Mount Royal is where Montrealers go to get a breath of air on a hot day, to cross-country ski without leaving the city, to walk off a hangover or a bad mood, to picnic, to jog, to ice skate, to look out over the city, rest their eyes on the horizon and dream. <br> To get to Mount Royal park you only need to start up any hill from downtown and you’ll eventually find yourself there. A trail from the Cartier monument on the Park Avenue side (bus <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/bus\/PLAN_LIG\/A-PL80.htm\"><strong>80<\/strong><\/a><strong> or <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/bus\/PLAN_LIG\/A-PL129.htm\"><strong>129<\/strong><\/a><strong>) winds gradually upward toward the top. Or go to <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/metro\/a-m09.htm\"><strong>Mont-Royal metro station<\/strong><\/a><strong> and take the <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/bus\/PLAN_LIG\/A-PL11.htm\"><strong>11 bus<\/strong><\/a><strong>. You can also drive up via Côte-des-Neiges and the Voie Camillien-Houde: there are various well-marked parking lots off the road. <br> Mount Royal shares the top of the mountain with several cemeteries: a huge Roman Catholic one, a large nondenominational one, and two quite small contiguous Jewish ones. Although not properly speaking parks, the <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cimetierenddn.org\/\"><strong>Notre-Dame-des-Neiges<\/strong><\/a><strong>and <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountroyalcem.com\/\"><strong>Mount Royal Cemetery<\/strong><\/a><strong> can be pleasant places to stroll. Mount Royal Cemetery is especially pretty in May when flowering trees are in season, and again in the autumn. <br> Across Côte-des-Neiges and up a fairly brisk hill is Westmount's Summit Park, a mostly forested area popular with dog walkers and nature observers. There are wild plants in Summit Park which are scarce elsewhere on the Island of Montreal. <br> Another peak of the mountain is occupied by the <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.umontreal.ca\/\"><strong>University of Montreal<\/strong><\/a><strong>, whose tower can be seen from the top of the mountain, as can the imposing dome of <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saint-joseph.org\/\"><strong>St. Joseph’s Oratory<\/strong><\/a><strong> visible beyond Notre-Dame-des-Neiges.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/0\/a\/600_426886602.jpeg\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/9\/c\/600_426887772.jpeg\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Mount Royal, located in the heart of the city of Montreal,provides some interesting sites for bird photography and observation.

Mount Royal Park was officially opened on Queen Victoria’s birthday, Wednesday, May 24, 1876. The opening ceremony on the mountain was preceded by a parade through the streets of Montréal. The parade left from the post office on St. Jacques Street in old Montréal at 10 a.m. As reported in the Opinion Publique, a newspaper of the period, the procession set off in no particular order and stopped for a while on Bleury Street, where three volunteer regiments, escorted by their musical bands, momentarily blocked traffic. The procession then turned onto the newly paved St. Catherine Road and made its way to the summit of the mountain along the magnificent thoroughfare. Citizens came out to the mountain in their thousands to await the arrival of the parade and the inauguration ceremonies, laden with provisions for “a pantagruelic picnic seasoned with a great deal of gaiety,” according to the Opinion Publique. Speeches <br> A few minutes before noon, Dr. Wolfred Nelson, Councillor, and Chair of the Mount Royal Park Commission, invited the Mayor of Montréal, William H. Hingston, to open the day’s proceedings. But it was Mayor Aldis Bernard who had been the prime mover behind the creation of the park. At City Hall from 1873 to 1875, Aldis Bernard was nicknamed the mayor of parks. It was under his administration that three major park projects were undertaken. Besides Mount Royal Park, Montrealers were given two other public green spaces: Île Sainte-Hélène and Lafontaine Park (Logan farm). Shortly before Mayor Hingston ended his address, the four cannons of Colonel Stevenson’s battery fired the first salvo of the royal salute, which was responded to by the artillery of Île Sainte-Hélène. This was not the first time that Colonel Stevenson had fired his cannon from the mountain. In response to those who claimed that the mountain was inaccessible, he climbed Mount Royal with his battery twice, in 1862 and 1863, and fired the cannon from the summit. His gesture did not go unnoticed and Colonel Stevenson thus contributed in his own way to the creation of Mount Royal Park. The opening ceremony featured other speakers besides Councillor Nelson and Mayor Hingston. One of them was Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Mount Royal Park. This famous landscape architect, the creator of New York’s Central Park, had been mandated by the city of Montréal to plan the park. Olmsted wished to preserve the natural charm of the mountain. The winding path he laid out, which today bears his name, was designed to allow people to discover the beauty of this natural space. He wanted the park to be accessible to everyone, regardless of social class or physical condition. His wish was to be fulfilled. When the speeches ended, Colonel Stevenson began the hundred-gun salute marking the occasion. Mount Royal Park’s opening day would be fondly remembered by the thousands of Montrealers who attended the festivities. Frederick Law Olmsted Frederick Law Olmsted drew the design plans for Mount Royal Park in an age where he was considered the most famous landscape architect in North America. To appreciate Olmsted's work, one must keep in mind the era in which he lived. Olmsted lived from 1822 to 1903 and witnessed the transformation of North America from a rural and agricultural society to an urbanized and industrialized one. In 1800, only 10% of Americans lived in communities of over 1,000, but by 1910, 46% of the population lived in urban centres. In the 1830s, trains began to run in the United States. By 1840, there were 5,000 kilometres of track. In 1900, people and merchandise could travel on a network of 320,000 kilometres of railroad track. Social change did not occur without problems. In midlife, Olmsted began attempting to mitigate the upheavals of industrialization and urbanization through his work as a landscape architect. Before that, he had explored the world and worked at several trades in the fast-changing western world. Each of his experiences influenced his approach to landscape and nature. A descendant of founding pilgrims from New England, Olmsted was born in 1822 in Hartford to a family of merchants. His childhood was influenced by the landscapes of the Connecticut River, which he explored with his family. By the time he was 18, he had attended 13 different schools ranging from neighbourhood schools run by kindly gentlewomen to brutal boarding schools and strict religious institutions. His education was interspersed with salutary hiking trips through the countryside. He worked as a clerk in New York for two years before returning to Hartford at the age of 20.

His energetic, comically-insightful act is 100-percent profanity-free and filled with observations about his everyday encounters. He loves to make people laugh and found a way to line up his passions with his career and that is what sets him apart.<\/p>\n<p>Sam keeps the humor appropriate for all his audiences, whether that be headlining a night in a comedy club or performing at a corporate event. Sam was a winner at the Great American Comedy Festival in 2009. In addition, this genre-jumping comedian has shared the stage with both touring comedians and musicians ranging from comedians such as Frank Caliendo, Phil Palisoul, Jake Johannsen, and Mike Epps to musicians including Rick Springfield, Al Jarreau, The Spinners, The Guess Who and David Sanborn. Adams has written a book titled If You Don't Believe Me: Lessons Learned From Listening To The Greats. Currently, Sam can be seen on 9NEWS' weekend newscast segment 'Sports A to Z.'<\/p>","name":"Singles go see a comedy show at Comedy Works DTC","group":{"id":1771002,"category":{"id":30,"name":"singles","shortname":"singles"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/8\/5\/600_21028805.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/8\/5\/highres_21028805.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/8\/5\/thumb_21028805.jpeg","photo_id":21028805},"group_lat":39.75,"name":"Dating in Denver","state":"CO","group_lon":-104.99,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"DatinginDenver","country":"us","city":"Denver"}}

This player has obvious stroke weaknesses but is familiar with basic positions for singles and doubles play.<\/p>\n<p><a>2.5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player is learning to judge where the ball is going although court coverage is weak. Can sustain a short rally of slow pace with other players of the same ability.<\/p>\n<p><a>3.0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player is fairly consistent when hitting medium paced shorts, but is not comfortable with all strokes and lacks execution when trying for directional control, depth, or power. Most common doubles formation is one-up, one-back.<\/p>\n<p><a>3.5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player has achieved improved stroke dependability with directional control on moderate shots, but still lacks depth and variety. This player exhibits more aggressive net play, has improved court coverage, and is developing teamwork in doubles.<\/p>\n<p><a>4.0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player has dependable strokes, including directional control and depth on both forehand and backhand sides on moderate shots, plus the ability to use lobs, overheads, approach shots and volleys with some success. This player occasionally forces errors when serving. Rallies may be lost due to impatience. Teamwork in doubles is evident.<\/p>\n<p><a>4.5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player has begun to master the use of power and spins and is beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots, and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents. This player can hit first serves with power and accuracy and place the second serve. This player tends to over hit on difficult shots. Aggressive net play is common in doubles.<\/p>\n<p><a>5.0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player has good shot anticipation and frequently has an outstanding shot or attribute around which a game may be structured. This player can regularly hit winners or force errors off of short balls and can put away volleys, can successfully execute lobs, drop shots, half volleys, overhead smashes, and has good depth and spin on most 2nd serves.<\/p>\n<p><a>5.5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This player has developed power and\/or consistency as a major weapon. This player can vary strategies and styles of play in a competitive situation and hits dependable shots in a stress situation.<\/p>\n<p><a>6.0 to 7.0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The 6.0 player typically has had intensive training for national tournament competition at the junior and collegiate levels and has obtained a sectional and\/or national ranking. The 7.0 is a world class player.<\/p>\n<p>infos obtains from the following link!&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usta.com\/Play-Tennis\/USTA-League\/Information\/About_NTRP\/\">http:\/\/www.usta.com\/Play-Tennis\/USTA-League\/Information\/About_NTRP\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usta.com\/Play-Tennis\/USTA-League\/Information\/About_NTRP\/\"><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usta.com\/Play-Tennis\/USTA-League\/Information\/About_NTRP\/\"><\/a><\/span><\/p>","name":"Night Indoor tennis!!

That's what we've created!<\/p> \n<p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or sports bar conversation.<\/p> \n<p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening – to your responses.<\/p> \n<p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> \n<p>We play three communication games that will challenge you to consider questions like 'What are your relationships like?' 'What does Orgasm mean to you?' and 'What's one secret desire you have?'<\/p> \n<p>Questions like these encourage vulnerability. And, what happens when you get vulnerable? It creates intimacy... which is what we're all searching for!<\/p> \n<p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.<\/p> \n<p>OneTaste as an organization teaches a practice called Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!) - sort of like having the feeling of an incredible dessert without having consumed any of the calories. You can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you. You don't have to do anything you don't want to, or answer any questions you don't want to answer.<\/p> \n<p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> \n<p>We start on time so please arrive fifteen minutes early.<\/p> \n<p>COST TO ATTEND IS $10.<\/p> \n<p>For questions contact Brenda Marino,&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>[masked] or[masked]<\/p>","name":"TurnON","group":{"id":17499912,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/600_434433249.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/highres_434433249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/thumb_434433249.jpeg","photo_id":434433249},"group_lat":40.64,"name":"TurnON Long Island","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.2,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"TurnOn-Long-Island","country":"us","city":"Bay Shore"}}

PLEASE do not call right before it's time to leave or I will be late.

So check with me before applying or use what I'm bringing. (The toxic sunscreens cause skin cancer as well as smelling bad.) It's easier and safer to just cover up exposed skin.(Sorry to repeat NO scents, but so often someone who is making us nauseous says, \"But I'm only wearing .....\" Mainstream laundry detergent is also extremely toxic.)

One cannot enjoy the trail if it rains.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- we will be walking some parts on very slippery trails, so you need to have proper walking shoes\/equipement with you. And watch your steps!!!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/3\/5\/600_434973845.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>What you need during the walk:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- enough time, no stress or rushing. I am planning to leave Merten around 5pm. The walk itself is about 16km in total and without breaks we need ca. 3,5 hours for that. It depends on the &nbsp;condition of the group and the number of breaks, if it takes less or longer than 5pm to hit&nbsp; the road back home. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- as mentioned before, proper walking shoes and equipement, enough water\/drinks and snacks, as we won't be stopping for a meal during the walk. The plan is to have &nbsp;just short stops in between for a little refreshement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- good mood and some middle good condition. The trail itself is not very difficult, just few ups and downs (total ups - 211m; total downs - 285m) however with some &nbsp;great views ;)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- some money for the ticket leaving from Bonn, Cologne, Troisdorf and, and, and...towards Merten and going back; optionally something for a drink after the hike.<\/p>\n<p>I will be leaving at 11:18am from Bonn Beuel Bahnhof, platform 2, arriving in Troisdorf at 11:27am to get the next train to Merten at 11:54am (S12 direction Au\/Sieg), arriving at 12:13pm in Merten.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is your decision, where you want to join the group. We will be starting the hike around 12:15pm from Merten Bahnhof. If you want to join me already in Bonn Beuel, be aware, that there is no ticket service at the station. You can buy your ticket only at the ticket machine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you want to join the others on the group ticket, please be there around 11am, however I cannot &nbsp;guarantee any group tickets. I hope we will be having a great hike, with lots of sunshine and some happy folks.

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission , saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":17499912,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/600_434433249.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/highres_434433249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/thumb_434433249.jpeg","photo_id":434433249},"group_lat":40.64,"name":"TurnON Long Island","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.2,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"TurnOn-Long-Island","country":"us","city":"Bay Shore"}}

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission , saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":17499912,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/600_434433249.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/highres_434433249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/e\/1\/thumb_434433249.jpeg","photo_id":434433249},"group_lat":40.64,"name":"TurnON Long Island","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.2,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"TurnOn-Long-Island","country":"us","city":"Bay Shore"}}

This player has obvious stroke weaknesses but is familiar with basic positions for singles and doubles play.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>2.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player is learning to judge where the ball is going although court coverage is weak. Can sustain a short rally of slow pace with other players of the same ability.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>3.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player is fairly consistent when hitting medium paced shorts, but is not comfortable with all strokes and lacks execution when trying for directional control, depth, or power. Most common doubles formation is one-up, one-back.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>3.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has achieved improved stroke dependability with directional control on moderate shots, but still lacks depth and variety. This player exhibits more aggressive net play, has improved court coverage, and is developing teamwork in doubles.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>4.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has dependable strokes, including directional control and depth on both forehand and backhand sides on moderate shots, plus the ability to use lobs, overheads, approach shots and volleys with some success. This player occasionally forces errors when serving. Rallies may be lost due to impatience. Teamwork in doubles is evident.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>4.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has begun to master the use of power and spins and is beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots, and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents. This player can hit first serves with power and accuracy and place the second serve. This player tends to over hit on difficult shots. Aggressive net play is common in doubles.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>5.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has good shot anticipation and frequently has an outstanding shot or attribute around which a game may be structured. This player can regularly hit winners or force errors off of short balls and can put away volleys, can successfully execute lobs, drop shots, half volleys, overhead smashes, and has good depth and spin on most 2nd serves.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>5.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has developed power and\/or consistency as a major weapon. This player can vary strategies and styles of play in a competitive situation and hits dependable shots in a stress situation.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>6.0 to 7.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>The 6.0 player typically has had intensive training for national tournament competition at the junior and collegiate levels and has obtained a sectional and\/or national ranking.

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p>\n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p>\n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p>\n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission, saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do.

This player has obvious stroke weaknesses but is familiar with basic positions for singles and doubles play.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>2.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player is learning to judge where the ball is going although court coverage is weak. Can sustain a short rally of slow pace with other players of the same ability.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>3.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player is fairly consistent when hitting medium paced shorts, but is not comfortable with all strokes and lacks execution when trying for directional control, depth, or power. Most common doubles formation is one-up, one-back.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>3.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has achieved improved stroke dependability with directional control on moderate shots, but still lacks depth and variety. This player exhibits more aggressive net play, has improved court coverage, and is developing teamwork in doubles.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>4.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has dependable strokes, including directional control and depth on both forehand and backhand sides on moderate shots, plus the ability to use lobs, overheads, approach shots and volleys with some success. This player occasionally forces errors when serving. Rallies may be lost due to impatience. Teamwork in doubles is evident.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>4.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has begun to master the use of power and spins and is beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots, and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents.

Aggressive net play is common in doubles.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>5.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has good shot anticipation and frequently has an outstanding shot or attribute around which a game may be structured. This player can regularly hit winners or force errors off of short balls and can put away volleys, can successfully execute lobs, drop shots, half volleys, overhead smashes, and has good depth and spin on most 2nd serves.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>5.5<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>This player has developed power and\/or consistency as a major weapon. This player can vary strategies and styles of play in a competitive situation and hits dependable shots in a stress situation.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><a>6.0 to 7.0<\/a><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>The 6.0 player typically has had intensive training for national tournament competition at the junior and collegiate levels and has obtained a sectional and\/or national ranking.

Cortisol is associated with overeating, deep abdominal fat and craving high-calorie fatty and sugary foods.<\/p> \n<p>Considering the importance of reducing stress, as part of an overall lifestyle strategy, here are three yoga tips for weight loss:<\/p> \n<p>1. Use the Breath.<\/p> \n<p>Yogic movements are based on pranayama, or breath work. My class uses the breath of “ha,” based on laughter, to lower stress levels.<\/p> \n<p>Deep breathing and laughter have been shown to increase relaxation, lower blood pressure, release endorphins and increase stress management skills.<\/p> \n<p>The more we breathe during yoga, the more we will feel the benefits in our life. We’ll experience lower levels of the stress hormones that cause us to feel anxiety—especially causing us to overeat.<\/p> \n<p>When we’re happy, weight loss is easier.<\/p> \n<p>2. Use the Legs.<\/p> \n<p>Yoga should raise our heart rate. Especially if we use the large muscle groups in our legs to move.<\/p> \n<p>Poses like warrior one and warrior two are effective at engaging the quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteus muscles, to elevate heart rate and burn more calories.<\/p> \n<p>The more we use our legs, for jumping, dancing or balancing, the more calories we’ll burn!<\/p> \n<p>3. Laugh.<\/p> \n<p>As a laughter yoga instructor, I know the importance of releasing stress through laughter.<\/p> \n<p>And as we all know, laughing tightens the abdominal muscles!<\/p> \n<p>We can laugh our way to toned abs, burn calories and lower stress by using laughter yoga exercises.<\/p> \n<p>William F. Fry, associate professor emeritus of clinical psychiatry at Stanford University, says “A belly laugh is internal jogging.” Laughing involves “a great deal of physical exercise and muscular behavior.”— 15 facial muscles plus dozens of others all over the body that flex and relax.<\/p> \n<p>When we laugh, our heart rate increases, oxygenating the blood.<\/p> \n<p>”Laughing 100 to 200 times per day is the cardiovascular equivalent of rowing for 10 minutes.” ~ William F. Fry<\/p> \n<p>Other studies have found that laughter bolsters the immune system, regulates abnormal heartbeat related to stress, improves the respiratory system and relaxes muscle tension.<\/p> \n<p>In summary, breathe, use our strong legs and laugh! We will be sure to soon feel the benefits as we relax more, lower stress, curb overeating, burn calories—bringing more peace and joy into our life, with the practice of yoga.<\/p> \n<p> Relephant:<\/p> \n<p>The Importance of Laughter.<br>Author: Beth Bongar<\/p> \n<p>Editor: Melissa Tamura\/ Editor: Ashleigh Hitchcock<\/p> \n<p>Photo: courtesy of the author<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.elephantjournal.com\/2015\/02\/laughing-our-way-toward-weight-loss\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.elephantjournal.com\/2015\/02\/laughing-our-way-toward-weight-loss\/<\/a><\/p>","name":" Laugh Our way Toward Weight Loss","group":{"id":5771152,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/2\/2\/600_378380002.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/2\/2\/highres_378380002.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/2\/2\/thumb_378380002.jpeg","photo_id":378380002},"group_lat":40.79,"name":"Laughing Diva's Laughter Yoga NYC Club","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.98,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"LaughterYogaNYC-Club","country":"us","city":"New York"}}

For this month, we will be at Aperture Studio at 2840 Chatham Street in Philadelphia, PA. We will have ample space to work in, allowing models and photographers to concentrate on a variety of creative ideas. Photographers are encouraged to bring items they need to be creative, keeping in mind to have any setups reasonable. Most props are encouraged (no weapon props or open flames) to help with adding originality. The model list will be updated as we get close to the event, so check back frequently for the latest additions.<\/p> \n<p>Of special note for this event, we are EXTREMELY pleased to present a very cool music experience. Little War Twins (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.littlewartwins.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.littlewartwins.com\/<\/a>) will be performing a killer set of music that will be sure to please everyone. Check out their site, listen to their music (buy their download!), and you will be excited to see them live.

Each noise a voice in itself, telling a story whether he wanted to hear it nor not, cascading from above, or rolling in from below. From all angles it came at him, tugging at his purposeful walk. Despite the shouts of angry patrons, or the cooing of false promises from the beauties he passed by, his feet kept him moving forward. The street lamps blanketed the sidewalk with their own cadence, as if he was walking across a chessboard. Trash cans stood as squat sentries, some overflowing with the debris of convenience, some with fire playing above the rim for a few seeking warmth. Puddles from the days rain were splashed at times by transporters whose passengers did not want to stop, but were still in search of something unspoken. The moon struggled to peak out around the shadowed clouds, hinting that the night was soon to be bathed in her fullness, even if the chill of darkness kept the body moving.<\/p> \n<p>He rounded the corner to find himself on Aramingo, or that's what it used to be called. His great-grandfather, affectionately called G-Papp, used to say that before the Great Change, the streets used to have metal signs that read with their name, and that people used cars or buses to get where they were going. His stories of traffic lights, pot holes, convenience stores, and the trappings of the Pre-Change culture seemed so far away. People used to walk and mingle on the streets as part of their daily lives, breathing the air without using a thelium tube. So strange to him! Breathing the air as it was, with no concern of a painful termination. To no such worries. It must have been quite an experience.<\/p> \n<p>His thoughts ended as approached the alley he knew well. A nondescript, typical entry way between sub domes, that was often shrouded by shadows of curving roofs. He was sure that while some things from the past were kept, much was abandoned to embrace the symmetry of the Ones. But alleys seemed to be harbor secrets, and this one held a special secret that not many knew of. Dropping his spare thelium tube on purpose, he bent to pick it up, making the signal with his thumb and forefinger. Within moments, a flash of light pierced out from the shadows of the alley, giving him clearance. He gave a cursory glance around him, knowing that for the next few seconds, the millions of cameras watching his every move would be hit with a few seconds of static, giving him enough time to step into the darkness and through the faux door that was opened for him.<\/p> \n<p>The only sound of the door closing was a faint bump, and then silence. The viso droids fluttered around him, scanning for any potential bugs or, as the old school term was called, a 'wire'. He wasn't worried, as he was a regular here, and they knew him. But familiarity did not mean access, and within moments he heard the beep of approval from the viso droids.<\/p> \n<p>Light spilled out in front of him as a second door opened up. He passed through, stepping out of the darkness and into the light, hearing then the voices of others who came here for the same purpose. It was a big crowd today, not the usual handful of people using their credits for a brief escape. He made sure he had a few extra vrillars to spend before walking over, allowing himself the luxury of options, something that he seldom had the chance to do.<\/p> \n<p>Placing his coat on a hook at his usual station, he sat before red screen he knew so well. He removed his thelium tube and placed it on the desk in front of him, and reamained still as the machine slowly encased him in what was affectionately called the pod. He felt his feet become secured to the floor, soon followed by his arms being locked down onto the arm rest, and then his head to the rest. The computer's voice then said \"Close your eyes, please,\" and he complied with out any fight. The machine felt a bit gruff to some, but he had long embraced the rigidity as a part of the process.<\/p> \n<p>\"Scanning thought waves,\" it said. A brief hum followed, which he called the tuning fork. It always reminded him of the nitrous gas one had to breath during implant process when he was young, when you didn't know enough to object to the mandated micro-chipping. You were old enough to know that something was going on, but too young to ask questions. But he learned to fix that problem later on, along with a few other things. He was one of the lucky ones.<\/p> \n<p>When the tuning fork was done, the machine's voice continued.<\/p> \n<p>\"Destination?\"<\/p> \n<p>\"Philadelphia,\" he responded. \"2015, April.\"<\/p> \n<p>\"Stand by,\" it came back with. He could swear it sounded a slight bit agitated, but he often over thought such things.<\/p> \n<p>\"Pass code?\" it asked, sounding pleasantly inhuman but predictable.<\/p> \n<p>\"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux,\" he responded, as he felt the system begin the transport process. G-Papp always talked about how it was a life changing time for him, because he didn't have toys like this when he was young. He knew his great-grandfather, were he alive today, would be amazed at the ability to thought travel. He owed him everything, as G-Papp's DNA was in his blood too. That gave him access to so many experiences that he would otherwise never have. \"Does not compute. Repeat,\" came the response. Damn, this unit didn't have a translator installed, he thought. But it didn't matter which model he had, as they all did the same job. You work with what you got.<\/p> \n<p>\"Hear, See, Sexy, Light,\" he responded. And that was it. The machine took over, placing his body in the usual temp stasis, while his mind was then taken back to a date that made history.<\/p>","name":"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux","group":{"id":521524,"category":{"id":8,"name":"fashion\/beauty","shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/9\/e\/600_433746558.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/9\/e\/highres_433746558.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/9\/e\/thumb_433746558.jpeg","photo_id":433746558},"group_lat":40.12,"name":"Models + Photographers","state":"PA","group_lon":-75.01,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"ModelPhoto","country":"us","city":"Philadelphia"}}

He loves to make people laugh and found a way to line up his passions with his career and that is what sets him apart.<\/p> \n<p>Sam keeps the humor appropriate for all his audiences, whether that be headlining a night in a comedy club or performing at a corporate event. Sam was a winner at the Great American Comedy Festival in 2009. In addition, this genre-jumping comedian has shared the stage with both touring comedians and musicians ranging from comedians such as Frank Caliendo, Phil Palisoul, Jake Johannsen, and Mike Epps to musicians including Rick Springfield, Al Jarreau, The Spinners, The Guess Who and David Sanborn. Adams has written a book titled If You Don't Believe Me: Lessons Learned From Listening To The Greats.

His energetic, comically-insightful act is 100-percent profanity-free and filled with observations about his everyday encounters. He loves to make people laugh and found a way to line up his passions with his career and that is what sets him apart.<\/p>\n<p>Sam keeps the humor appropriate for all his audiences, whether that be headlining a night in a comedy club or performing at a corporate event. Sam was a winner at the Great American Comedy Festival in 2009. In addition, this genre-jumping comedian has shared the stage with both touring comedians and musicians ranging from comedians such as Frank Caliendo, Phil Palisoul, Jake Johannsen, and Mike Epps to musicians including Rick Springfield, Al Jarreau, The Spinners, The Guess Who and David Sanborn. Adams has written a book titled If You Don't Believe Me: Lessons Learned From Listening To The Greats. Currently, Sam can be seen on 9NEWS' weekend newscast segment 'Sports A to Z.'<\/p>","name":"Singles to see a comedy show at Comedy Works DTC","group":{"id":1692774,"category":{"id":30,"name":"singles","shortname":"singles"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/2\/6\/600_132998182.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/2\/6\/highres_132998182.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/2\/6\/thumb_132998182.jpeg","photo_id":132998182},"group_lat":39.73,"name":"Denver Singles Lock & Key Parties","state":"CO","group_lon":-104.98,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"denversingleslockandkeyparties","country":"us","city":"Denver"}}

She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission, saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":6643612,"category":{"id":1,"name":"fine arts\/culture","shortname":"arts-culture"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/1\/6\/600_195623062.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/1\/6\/highres_195623062.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/1\/6\/thumb_195623062.jpeg","photo_id":195623062},"group_lat":40.66,"name":"Artists, Writers, Musicians, and other Creative People","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.68,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Artists-Writers-and-Musicians-of-Lynbrook-Rockville-Center","country":"us","city":"Lynbrook"}}

In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p>\n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission, saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":6643612,"category":{"id":1,"name":"fine arts\/culture","shortname":"arts-culture"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/1\/6\/600_195623062.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/1\/6\/highres_195623062.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/1\/6\/thumb_195623062.jpeg","photo_id":195623062},"group_lat":40.66,"name":"Artists, Writers, Musicians, and other Creative People","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.68,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Artists-Writers-and-Musicians-of-Lynbrook-Rockville-Center","country":"us","city":"Lynbrook"}}

His energetic, comically-insightful act is 100-percent profanity-free and filled with observations about his everyday encounters. He loves to make people laugh and found a way to line up his passions with his career and that is what sets him apart.<\/p> \n<p>Sam keeps the humor appropriate for all his audiences, whether that be headlining a night in a comedy club or performing at a corporate event. Sam was a winner at the Great American Comedy Festival in 2009. In addition, this genre-jumping comedian has shared the stage with both touring comedians and musicians ranging from comedians such as Frank Caliendo, Phil Palisoul, Jake Johannsen, and Mike Epps to musicians including Rick Springfield, Al Jarreau, The Spinners, The Guess Who and David Sanborn. Adams has written a book titled If You Don't Believe Me: Lessons Learned From Listening To The Greats. Currently, Sam can be seen on 9NEWS' weekend newscast segment 'Sports A to Z.'<\/p>","name":"Singles to see a comedy show at Comedy Works DTC","group":{"id":289977,"category":{"id":30,"name":"singles","shortname":"singles"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/a\/600_84350522.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/a\/highres_84350522.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/a\/thumb_84350522.jpeg","photo_id":84350522},"group_lat":39.7,"name":"The Rocky Mountain Singles Meetup Group","state":"CO","group_lon":-105.08,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"denversingles","country":"us","city":"Denver"}}

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission , saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":1653073,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/600_119651342.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/highres_119651342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/thumb_119651342.jpeg","photo_id":119651342},"group_lat":40.71,"name":"Greater NYC and Long Island Over 40 and Ready For Fun","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.67,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"NYC-Single-Over-40-and-Ready-For-Fun","country":"us","city":"Franklin Square"}}

Qigong is an ancient art of healing and spiritual development, the prequel of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Spiritual Development practiced in the countries of Orient. Qigong translates as qi – energy, gong – movement, thus energy movement. During one hour of meditation we “move” our “energies” to unwind, ground, and recharge.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n All are welcome. We begin our session with a short discussion of different types of qigong meditation, simple and effective for beginners as well as seasoned meditators. Our meditation is very informal and you can choose your own place in the room, your position and the type of meditation you enjoy. All we ask is to be respectful to each other, relax and enjoy. To finish up the meditation we share any knowledge or experience related to the moment over the cup of warm tea.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n What to wear or bring:<br>\n\n Wear your most comfortable clothes. We have blankets, thick yoga mats, and regular or reclining chairs. If you need anything special like cushions or foam blocks please bring it with you. Please be mindful to others and wear no perfume.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There is no fee, but we are asking for $5 donation to cover heat and air conditioning, lights and cleaning services.

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission , saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":1653073,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/600_119651342.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/highres_119651342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/thumb_119651342.jpeg","photo_id":119651342},"group_lat":40.71,"name":"Greater NYC and Long Island Over 40 and Ready For Fun","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.67,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"NYC-Single-Over-40-and-Ready-For-Fun","country":"us","city":"Franklin Square"}}

In essence, EFT is an emotional version of acupuncture without the needles. The idea behind EFT is the fact that the discovery of all negative emotions is a disruption in the energy system. If properly done, EFT appears to balance disturbances in the meridian or energy system of the body as you tune into specific issues or aspects while tapping certain meridian points of the face and upper body. This then allows balance or clearing to take place. A good flowing energy system is vital to our mental, physical and emotional health.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/2\/a\/600_300603882.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p><b>Class Description:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In this class you will learn the basics of EFT and how it has been proven to free you from any emotional blockages and help you heal emotional issues.

NEW GATE SYSTEM! PLEASE READ!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>This is our weekly Board Games night at our house in Ashburn. We have been hosing this event for over 10 years now. Always interested in finding new people who would like to attend. Information is also posted frequently on FaceBook and on LiveJournal.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>FB: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/#!\/home.php?sk=group_[masked]\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/#!\/home.php?sk=group_[masked]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is a Google \"My Maps\" that shows the area around Chez Turtle. It shows the best gate to enter the community, the good places to park, etc. <a href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/9vjkq\">http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/9vjkq<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE HAVE A NEW GATE SYSTEM!<\/b> <i>In order to gain entry into the development you need to send either your name or your name and email address to [masked]. That way I can add you to the guest list and\/or send you a QR code. The name on the guest list will allow you to come in the front gate by telling the gate guard \"Games Night\" and giving him\/her your name. Please note on the google maps above where the front gate is located. The QR code will allow you to \"scan\" yourself in via smartphone or printout through the back gate which is closer to the house. If you have any questions about this, please contact Becky at [masked].<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Doors open at 7. Bring your dinner and sit down with us for a meal. Dinner is between 7 and 8, then the kitchen table turns into a games table. Games can start as people show up. When we have 4 people, we can start a game. If you show up after 8:15 or so, you may end up waiting a while for the first round of games to end so you can fit into a game. What do you feel like playing? Suggest a game.<\/p>\n<p><span>No really, what do you play?<br>\n\n Dominion, Power Grid, Pirate's Cove, Battlestar Galactica, To Court The King, Ticket to Ride, Fun Factory, Entdecker, Kingsburg, Gloom, Risk Legacy, Tikal, 7 Wonders, Killer Bunnies, Ascension, Settlers of Cataan, Hansa Teutonica, Guillotine, Smallworld, Tigris &amp; Euphrates, Fury Of Dracula, Apples to Apples, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Munchkin, Star Munchkin, Thurn and Taxis, El Grande, Arkham Horror, Icehouse, Bang, Tomb, Castle, Democrazy, Chez Geeek, Ivanhoe, Fluxx, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc<br>\n\n<br>\n\n What are \"fluffy\" and \"crunchy\" games?<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Fluffy: social, somewhat light hearted, fun, less math, less strategy, cooperative. GREAT for new people or people who don't normally consider themselves \"gamers\". IE \"fluffy bunny\" games, like \"fluffy bunny pagans\" or something. Good examples: Apples to Apples, Uno, Guillotine.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Crunchy: strategic, serious, more math, competitive. For people who are into gaming and want more \"kill your neighbor\" kinda games. IE \"something to crunch your teeth into\", meaning substantial. Good examples: Tigris and Euphrates, Settlers of Catan, Tikal, Risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n You are welcome to bring food, snacks, beverages, etc. One of the hosts, and at least one of our guests, is limited to gluten free foods. You don't have to bring gluten free, but if you do, it will be appreciated. Wine and cider are popular with our guests, beer is not. Fresh fruits\/veggies are also usually a big hit, as is chocolate! :)<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Parking Reminder: Park in the marked spaces if you intend to stay past 1am. Park on the side of the street that does not have no parking signs if you do park on the street.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Critter alert: We have cats. If you are allergic to critters, this is your early warning. Allergy induced fatal medical adventures are against the house rules.<\/p>\n\n","name":"Chez Turtle Weekly Games Night","group":{"id":357216,"category":{"id":11,"name":"games","shortname":"games"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/4\/3\/600_1319715.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/4\/3\/highres_1319715.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/4\/3\/thumb_1319715.jpeg","photo_id":1319715},"group_lat":38.98,"name":"The Herndon Boardgame Group","state":"VA","group_lon":-77.39,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"HerndonBoardgameGroup","country":"us","city":"Herndon"}}

That being the case, it's a very independent group, and we apologize in advance if you get lost or can't keep up. You can sign up for more individualized training at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canineconservatory.com\">www.canineconservatory.com<\/a><\/p> \n<p>WHY: Dog owners can ask dog training questions and socialize their dogs.

Our group tends to move quickly and likes to challenge ourselves and our dogs physically on new trails. Kurt will help you learn to handle your dog on trails by showing you how to keep your dog behind you as you descend trails. If you can't keep up, just take your time or back track. If you are a beginner hiker or if it's your first time, bring a friend so you aren't alone on the trail if you can't keep up.

There is no agenda just building great relationships. Both Mark Wright and I thought it would be a great idea to bring it to Vancouver and see if it would work..well it does.

It is based on individual appointments with a blend of philosophy and practical application. Each session is an hour long and costs $25.00. As a participant progesses, he\/she may choose to increase the amount that I am being paid in accordance with his\/her heart's desires.<\/p>\n<p>The sessions are designed to meet your needs. Some of you may have a lot of experience with Metaphysical processes, others may not. Your level of experience does not matter. The work is about improving the quality of your life. It revolves around self responsibility. We start where you are and go from there.<\/p>\n<p>I have been involved with metaphysics since 1980 and am very comfortaable with the following areas:<br>\n\n Spirit Communication<br>\n\n Intuitive\/Spiritual Healing (energy work)<br>\n\n Spiritual Coaching<br>\n\n Metaphysical Tutoring<br>\n\n Epigenetic Training-Learning how to change genes<br>\n\n Exploring Past Lives<\/p>\n<p>I am looking for people who are ready to improve the quality of their lives. The LOVE BUG JOURNEY begins with letting go of the pain of the past, which leads to making room for the present and creating a more fulfilling future. It is time for hearts to heal during this time of transformation on Planet Earth.<\/p>\n<p>The meetings are in my office at 2741 Campus Ave in Durham. We work out our meeting times according to our schedules. Another important part of the LOVE BUG PROJECT is that the participant chooses how often he\/she wants to meet. Time is scheduled in between appointments for assimilation and practical application. It might be a week, two weeks or a month. We adjust the appontments as we move forward.<\/p>\n<p>The LOVE BUG PROJECT is for anyone who is ready for their heart to heal. I look forward to working with any of you who choose to set up a LOVE BUG SESSION with me.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to share this information with others who might be helped by the Metaphysical perspective of living a fullfilling life.<\/p>\n<p>For an appointment for a LOVE BUG SESSION or further information send me a message or call me at[masked]-1009.<\/p>\n<p>Note* I had to set up beginning dates and a time for the meetup up so the announcement could be made.

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission, saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":1653073,"category":{"id":31,"name":"socializing","shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/600_119651342.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/highres_119651342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/4\/e\/thumb_119651342.jpeg","photo_id":119651342},"group_lat":40.71,"name":"Greater NYC and Long Island Over 40 and Ready For Fun","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.67,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"NYC-Single-Over-40-and-Ready-For-Fun","country":"us","city":"Franklin Square"}}

If you are an intermediate street skater you can make friends and enjoy a supportive environment as you start to get comfortable with this enjoyable activity. To accommodate as many levels as possible, there are many regroup points so that slower skaters can keep up, and faster skaters have a long time to take breaks and talk, or skate extra.<\/p>\n<p><b>Note for new skaters:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>• We skate downhill on 15th Street at the very start of the skate.<\/p>\n<p>• <i><b>If you prefer not to start the skate on a long incline<\/b><\/i> you can meet us at the National Archives, between 7th and 9th on Pennsylvania Ave, at 7:15. We'll be there, but please try and email ([masked]) us ahead of time so that we can be certain to pick you up.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>What skill level is this skate?<br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not all beginners will be ready for this skate! Although it is mostly flat, there is a downhill right at the start in the bike path on 15th St - you can skip that by meeting us at the National Archives, 7th and Penn. <br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Even if you skip that downhill start, you must be able to maintain a controlled speed and be able to stop at a red light.  You should have mastered at least two kinds of braking (e.g., heel braking, T-stopping, power slides, snowplowing, etc.) and be able to brake on an incline of at least 5-degrees.  We encourage skaters who would like to work on these skills to attend our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skatedc.org\/free-lessons\" target=\"_blank\">free lessons<\/a> in Rock Creek Park.<\/p>\n<p>Street skating requires more skill than trail skating.  While balance and steering techniques are essentially the same, skating in city streets and in potentially dangerous environments requires a higher competency. Like driving, you must be constantly searching for hazards and obstacles and be prepared to react by turning, stopping and avoiding.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>The Pace<br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While some choose to skate fast, the pace is relaxed with frequent breaks give it a leisurely feel.  Frequent regrouping and stops keep the group together and can accommodate most intermediate skaters. It is a social event so spend some time meeting and making friends at each stopping point. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/d\/e\/600_351013022.jpeg\" style=\"margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px\"><\/p>\n<p><b>Route<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We're back to our classic skate, but with a couple of changes to get us back to Penn Quarter for dinner afterwards.

Always interested in finding new people who would like to attend. Information is also posted frequently on FaceBook and on LiveJournal.<\/p>\n<p>FB: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/#!\/home.php?sk=group_[masked]\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/#!\/home.php?sk=group_[masked]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is a Google \"My Maps\" that shows the area around Chez Turtle.

That way I can add you to the guest list and\/or send you a QR code. The name on the guest list will allow you to come in the front gate by telling the gate guard \"Games Night\" and giving him\/her your name. Please note on the google maps above where the front gate is located. The QR code will allow you to \"scan\" yourself in via smartphone or printout through the back gate which is closer to the house. If you have any questions about this, please contact Becky at [masked].<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Doors open at 7. Bring your dinner and sit down with us for a meal. Dinner is between 7 and 8, then the kitchen table turns into a games table. Games can start as people show up. When we have 4 people, we can start a game. If you show up after 8:15 or so, you may end up waiting a while for the first round of games to end so you can fit into a game. What do you feel like playing? Suggest a game.<\/p>\n<p>No really, what do you play? <br>\n\nDominion, Power Grid, Pirate's Cove, Battlestar Galactica, To Court The King, Ticket to Ride, Fun Factory, Entdecker, Kingsburg, Gloom, Risk Legacy, Tikal, 7 Wonders, Killer Bunnies, Ascension, Settlers of Cataan, Hansa Teutonica, Guillotine, Smallworld, Tigris &amp; Euphrates, Fury Of Dracula, Apples to Apples, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Munchkin, Star Munchkin, Thurn and Taxis, El Grande, Arkham Horror, Icehouse, Bang, Tomb, Castle, Democrazy, Chez Geeek, Ivanhoe, Fluxx, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc <br>\n\n<br>\n\nWhat are \"fluffy\" and \"crunchy\" games? <br>\n\n<br>\n\nFluffy: social, somewhat light hearted, fun, less math, less strategy, cooperative. GREAT for new people or people who don't normally consider themselves \"gamers\". IE \"fluffy bunny\" games, like \"fluffy bunny pagans\" or something. Good examples: Apples to Apples, Uno, Guillotine. <br>\n\n<br>\n\nCrunchy: strategic, serious, more math, competitive. For people who are into gaming and want more \"kill your neighbor\" kinda games. IE \"something to crunch your teeth into\", meaning substantial. Good examples: Tigris and Euphrates, Settlers of Catan, Tikal, Risk.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\nYou are welcome to bring food, snacks, beverages, etc. One of the hosts, and at least one of our guests, is limited to gluten free foods. You don't have to bring gluten free, but if you do, it will be appreciated. Wine and cider are popular with our guests, beer is not. Fresh fruits\/veggies are also usually a big hit, as is chocolate! :) <br>\n\n<br>\n\nParking Reminder: Park in the marked spaces if you intend to stay past 1am. Park on the side of the street that does not have no parking signs if you do park on the street. <br>\n\n<br>\n\nCritter alert: We have cats. If you are allergic to critters, this is your early warning. Allergy induced fatal medical adventures are against the house rules.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n\n","name":"Chez Turtle Weekly Games Night","group":{"id":1605641,"category":{"id":11,"name":"games","shortname":"games"},"group_lat":39.03,"name":"Ashburn Boardgaming Group","state":"VA","group_lon":-77.49,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Ashburn-Gaming-Group","country":"us","city":"Ashburn"}}

All individuals interested in becoming a GAEA Member must attend a <i>New Seeker Orientation . . . the Guardian Gateway into GAEA. &nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Why the New Seeker Orientation?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The New Seeker Orientation is designed to create a Welcoming, Caring and Successful environment for new members. The purpose aimed at transitioning the Seeker into GAEA and addressing any questions that will alleviate stress for the new member. The New Seeker Orientation process is extensive to ensure your sincerity, dedication and commitment before we invest our time, energy and expertise in you. If you think this is too strict, then we recommend other groups that have no protection barriers to entry. <\/p>\n<p><b>Who is GAEA? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>GAEA is a religious, educational and social institution focused on establishing a sacred space where individuals can practice Gaean Paganism on a regular basis.&nbsp; Our dedicated Grove host monthly Moots where we celebrate in ritual. We do not promote alcoholism, illegal drug use or anything that is inappropriate for children or Military Personnel; therefore everything we do is “kid and military friendly.”<\/p>\n<p>The GAEA Grove contains private Covens within its border that is always open to New Seekers. However, GAEA is very selective about who is permitted to join our Grove. Our goal is to ensure that all energies are compatible for current and prospective members. It is important to note that all Seekers will not be granted acceptance into a Coven.

The purpose aimed at transitioning the Seeker into GAEA and addressing any questions that will alleviate stress for the new member. The New Seeker Orientation process is extensive to ensure your sincerity, dedication and commitment before we invest our time, energy and expertise in you. If you think this is too strict, then we recommend other groups that have no protection barriers to entry. <\/p>  \n<p><b>Who is GAEA? <\/b><\/p>  \n<p>GAEA is a religious, educational and social institution focused on establishing a sacred space where individuals can practice Gaean Paganism on a regular basis.&nbsp; Our dedicated Grove host monthly Moots where we celebrate in ritual. We do not promote alcoholism, illegal drug use or anything that is inappropriate for children or Military Personnel; therefore everything we do is “kid and military friendly.”<\/p>  \n<p>The GAEA Grove contains private Covens within its border that is always open to New Seekers. However, GAEA is very selective about who is permitted to join our Grove. Our goal is to ensure that all energies are compatible for current and prospective members. It is important to note that all Seekers will not be granted acceptance into a Coven. Only those granted acceptance will be offered a GAEA Membership with the ability to enroll in our Academy. <\/p>  \n<p><b>What to expect?<\/b><\/p>  \n<p>Each New Seeker meeting is an opportunity for prospective members to learn about GAEA and for GAEA to learn about you.

Clear out the ick you’ve accumulated from the week and start your weekend on a spiritual high! It is reported that Kundalini awakening results in deep meditation, enlightenment and bliss. ☺<\/p>\n<p>Kundalini is a latent spiritual energy located at the base of the spine. When it is awakened, it moves up towards the crown of the head. This creates a gradual shift in consciousness, balancing the body’s own healing energies and attuning the brain to higher levels of awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Each week we will call the kundalini to awaken through the meditation Ananda Mandala, Kundalini Yoga, and\/or Joyful Dancing. The session will always culminate with Deeksha, which is an energy transfer that assists in activating the Kundalini while quieting the chatterbox part of the mind, as well as connecting you to your personal Divine or Highest Consciousness within. You do not need to know anything to come participate in this practice, just willingness to open yourself to receive the gift of a blessing. All are welcome. As with most practices, the effects are cumulative, so the more you practice the more you receive.<\/p>\n<p>From my teacher, Sri Bhagavan: “Your connection with the Divine depends on the levels of your kundalini. The kundalini keeps fluctuating. It depends upon the hour or the day, it depends on the atmosphere, the food that you have eaten and the energy field and the sensory inputs. It keeps fluctuating. When it crosses the particular point, your connection with the divine is very good. Whereas it falls below the point, you lose the connection. You must learn not to blame yourself. If you keep blaming yourself, things get worse. Please understand you are not responsible. It will come back.” Let’s raise our kundalini together Joyfully, Ecstatically, Effortlessly!<\/p>\n<p>Kundalini workshop Friday 6-7pm at Bodhisattva Tea Spa, $5 to attend.<br>\n\n ***PLEASE ARRIVE ON TIME! Once Ananda Mandala starts you will not be able to join the circle. If you enter after we have started, please enter quietly and sit on edge of room, and perform the meditation there. You will be included in deeksha at the end. Please leave shoes outside room.<\/p>\n\n","name":"Kundalini Fridays!","group":{"id":2791732,"category":{"id":22,"name":"new age\/spirituality","shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/7\/4\/600_71626452.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/7\/4\/highres_71626452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/7\/4\/thumb_71626452.jpeg","photo_id":71626452},"group_lat":29.96,"name":"Awakening New Orleans","state":"LA","group_lon":-90.21,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Awakening-New-Orleans","country":"us","city":"New Orleans"}}

When Ansel Adams lobbied congress to create Kings Canyon national park using his photographs to show the beauty of the place, there was no doubt that what he showed was real. Now, that would be \"not so much\"... This is the case for all landscape photographers. At the Festival of Arts in Laguna Beach I continually hear \"did it really look like that, or did you Photoshop it?\"<\/p> \n<p>Roger was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but grew up in New York City. I earned a degree in Electrical Engineering at The City College of New York and have worked in the satellite industry my entire career. I&nbsp;first got interested in photography as a young adult, when I&nbsp;took a cross-country car trip and took photographs in several national parks along the way. I toured the Badlands of South Dakota, Mt. Rushmore, Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, the Grand Tetons, and into Oregon's Crater Lake.&nbsp;My&nbsp;interest in photography grew when I&nbsp;moved to California in 1977 and set up my&nbsp;first darkroom, in a bathroom. I&nbsp;eventually built a large, fully equipped darkroom to handle 4x5 negatives in 1983. Moving to California has allowed me to be close to many national parks in my state as well as in surrounding states, where there are&nbsp;many great places&nbsp;to photograph.<br><\/p> \n<p>------------------- <\/p> \n<p>• Parking: Limited free on-site parking, metered parking on street, accessibility parking on site and on street.

When Ansel Adams lobbied congress to create Kings Canyon national park using his photographs to show the beauty of the place, there was no doubt that what he showed was real. Now, that would be \"not so much\"... This is the case for all landscape photographers. At the Festival of Arts in Laguna Beach I continually hear \"did it really look like that, or did you Photoshop it?\"<\/p> \n<p>Roger was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but grew up in New York City. I earned a degree in Electrical Engineering at The City College of New York and have worked in the satellite industry my entire career. I&nbsp;first got interested in photography as a young adult, when I&nbsp;took a cross-country car trip and took photographs in several national parks along the way. I toured the Badlands of South Dakota, Mt. Rushmore, Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, the Grand Tetons, and into Oregon's Crater Lake.&nbsp;My&nbsp;interest in photography grew when I&nbsp;moved to California in 1977 and set up my&nbsp;first darkroom, in a bathroom. I&nbsp;eventually built a large, fully equipped darkroom to handle 4x5 negatives in 1983. Moving to California has allowed me to be close to many national parks in my state as well as in surrounding states, where there are&nbsp;many great places&nbsp;to photograph.<br><\/p> \n<p>------------------- <\/p> \n<p>• Parking: Limited free on-site parking, metered parking on street, accessibility parking on site and on street.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p>\n<p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p>\n<p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p>\n<p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p>\n<p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p>\n<p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p>\n<p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p>\n<p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.&nbsp; Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p>\n<br> \n<p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p>\n<p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p>\n<p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p>\n<p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p>\n<p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p>\n<p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p>\n<p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> \n<p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> \n<p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> \n<p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> \n<p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> \n<p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> \n<p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> \n<p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> \n<p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.&nbsp; Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> \n<br>\n<p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> \n<p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> \n<p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> \n<p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> \n<p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> \n<p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> \n<p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> \n<p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> \n<p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

When Ansel Adams lobbied congress to create Kings Canyon national park using his photographs to show the beauty of the place, there was no doubt that what he showed was real. Now, that would be \"not so much\"... This is the case for all landscape photographers. At the Festival of Arts in Laguna Beach I continually hear \"did it really look like that, or did you Photoshop it?\"<\/p>\n<p>Roger was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but grew up in New York City. I earned a degree in Electrical Engineering at The City College of New York and have worked in the satellite industry my entire career. I&nbsp;first got interested in photography as a young adult, when I&nbsp;took a cross-country car trip and took photographs in several national parks along the way. I toured the Badlands of South Dakota, Mt. Rushmore, Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, the Grand Tetons, and into Oregon's Crater Lake.&nbsp;My&nbsp;interest in photography grew when I&nbsp;moved to California in 1977 and set up my&nbsp;first darkroom, in a bathroom. I&nbsp;eventually built a large, fully equipped darkroom to handle 4x5 negatives in 1983. Moving to California has allowed me to be close to many national parks in my state as well as in surrounding states, where there are&nbsp;many great places&nbsp;to photograph.<br><\/p>\n<p>------------------- <\/p>\n<p>• Parking: Limited free on-site parking, metered parking on street, accessibility parking on site and on street.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p>\n<p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p>\n<p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.&nbsp; Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p>\n<br> \n<p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p>\n<p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p>\n<p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p>\n<p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p>\n<p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p>\n<p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p>\n<p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<br>","name":"Speeddating Ages 30-42- 3f\/3m spots left","group":{"id":742906,"category":{"id":30,"name":"singles","shortname":"singles"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/1\/2\/600_364693842.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/1\/2\/highres_364693842.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/1\/2\/thumb_364693842.jpeg","photo_id":364693842},"group_lat":40.78,"name":"Social Singles Ages 25-50","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.96,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"socialsinglesatwys","country":"us","city":"New York"}}

Goalies rotate every 5 minutes until everyone has played goalie, then the rotation starts all over again.<\/p>\n<p>There are no set teams; the game organizer divides the players into groups by passing out cards with team numbers which also has your place in the goalie rotation for your team.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome anyone over 18, both men and women; whether you're experienced or new to the game. All we ask is that you give it 100%; we value effort over ability.&nbsp;<br> <br> Call your own fouls and respect the call if someone calls a foul on you. We call all hand balls, intentional or not, so a hand ball stops play and no slide tackling.&nbsp;<br> <br> If there are any disputes, the game organizer has the final say, period.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> \n<p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> \n<p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> \n<p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> \n<p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> \n<p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> \n<p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> \n<p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> \n<p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.&nbsp; Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> \n<br>\n<p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> \n<p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> \n<p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> \n<p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> \n<p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> \n<p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> \n<p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> \n<p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> \n<p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> \n<p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> \n<p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

This is director John Boorman's first feature length film since 2006, and is a sequel to his well received memoir of growing up in London during the Blitz “Hope and Glory”. Mr. Boorman has said that this film will be the last one in his long film career (“Deliverance”, “Excaliber”, “The Emerald Forest”...). Here is a description of “Queen and Country” which is set in post World War II England:<\/p>\n<p>QUEEN AND COUNTRY is the hilarious follow-up to John Boorman's HOPE AND GLORY (1987 nominated for 5 Academy Awards), when 9-year-old Bill Rohan rejoices in the destruction of his school by an errant Luftwaffe bomb. QUEEN AND COUNTRY picks up the story nearly a decade later as Bill (Boorman's alter-ego), played by a charming Callum Turner, begins basic training in the early 1950s, during the Korean War. Bill is joined by a trouble-making army mate, Percy (Caleb Landry Jones). They never get near Korea, but engage in a constant battle of wits with the Catch-22-worthy, Sgt. Major Bradley -- the brilliant David Thewlis. Richard E. Grant is their superior, the veddy, veddy, infinitely put-upon, aptly-named Major Cross. A superb ensemble cast limns a wonderfully funny and often moving depiction of a still-recovering postwar England. <\/p>\n<p>Here is a preview of “Queen and Country”:<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p> \n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5oVLWqRSUU\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5oVLWqRSUU<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This film has an 86 rating at rottentomatoes.com. Here is the link to that web site where you can read or scan all the reviews to see if this film is for you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/queen_and_country\/\">http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/queen_and_country\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here are snippets from some of these reviews:<\/p>\n<p>“It has taken John Boorman almost three decades to make the sequel to his much-cherished \"Hope and Glory,\" but \"Queen and Country\" turns out to be well worth the wait.” (Wall Street Journal)<\/p>\n<p>“To watch \"Queen and Country\" is to get the impression of a man who has gone through life and actually learned something, which not everyone does.” (San Francisco Chronicle)<\/p>\n<p>“A lovely movie, as achingly bittersweet as all nostalgia, marked by surprising moments of commonplace beauty - a brilliant morning sky, a gently burbling Thames - and real rough emotion.” (Newark Star-Ledger)<\/p>\n<p>We will be patronizing the Sundance Cinemas. Meet me in the lounge on the second floor of the theater near the upstairs concession stand (this is between the main floor and the floor with the restrooms) starting at 4:45. I am an Asian male who wears glasses and who will probably be wearing a hat of some type. There is a head shot of me in the photo portion of my profile so you can see for whom to look. My cell phone,[masked], will be on until the start of the program at 5:00 Please note that this is a voice only phone so do not send text messages or post messages on a web site – I will not be able to read those.<\/p>\n<p>There will be an optional food and beverage stop at the conclusion of the showing (conclusion means after all of the credits have been shown). Meet me in the theater's lobby where we will discuss our options. We will wait awhile so that folks can make a pit stop at the conclusion of the film.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>","name":"John Boorman's \"Queen and Country\" @ Sundance (Sunday option)","group":{"id":295721,"category":{"id":20,"name":"movies\/film","shortname":"movies-film"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/3\/8\/600_13991576.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/3\/8\/highres_13991576.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/3\/8\/thumb_13991576.jpeg","photo_id":13991576},"group_lat":47.63,"name":"Seattle Cinema Club","state":"WA","group_lon":-122.32,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"seattle-cinema-club","country":"us","city":"Seattle"}}

The Root River Trail offers 60 miles of paved bicycle trails. The trail winds through the valley of the Root River, past towering 300-foot limestone bluffs, forests and rolling fields. Along the way, you may also see wildlife including wild turkeys, deer, hawks and turkey vultures. Rattlesnakes can occasionally be found on rock outcrops, along the river bottoms, or sunning themselves on the trail. Lanesboro is at the heart of the Root River Trail, which branches out in three directions. Each day, there will be an option for a bike ride on one of the three branches of the trail.<br>We will gather each evening, beginning Friday, September 4, for a group dinner and to discuss plans for the following day. Some people may choose to join the bicycle ride, while others may choose canoeing, kayaking or tubing on the river (Root River Outfitters, Little River General Store), going for a tour of the Amish community (Amish Backroads Tour, R &amp; M Amish Tours, Bluffscape Amish Tours) or visiting the Eagle Bluff Environmental Learning Center or the Lanesboro Arts Center. There is a theater within walking distance of our motels, so that is an option for evening entertainment.<br>Click here for photos from previous rides.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p>\n<p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p>\n<p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.&nbsp; Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p>\n<br> \n<p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p>\n<p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p>\n<p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p>\n<p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p>\n<p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p>\n<p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p>\n<p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><br> <\/p>\n<p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

We will spend the majority of our time in the great outdoors, taking advantage of the natural terrain to enhance our workout experience, both physically and mentally.<br>\n\n All of our classes are 10 people and under, so we can focus on individual performance and instruction. PaddleFit classes take place at a variety of amazing outdoor locations that are hand selected to provide you with an amazing experience and a killer workout. Whether your goals are weight loss, improving your overall health and conditioning, pushing your paddling technique to new heights or you just want a refreshing approach to working out that truly works, we have a program for you and we are excited to have you. Our main focus will be to help you achieve your goals and have fun, so the hard work you invest pays off and becomes a part of your healthier and happier lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Subjects covered:<br>\n\n Safety &amp; local laws regarding stand up paddle boarding<br>\n\n Equipment &amp; sizing paddle<br>\n\n Proper paddle technique<br>\n\n This 1 hour class is for beginners who wish to have a fun and safe first paddling experience. First we will fit you with the proper board, paddle, and safety gear. Then a Walk on Water Fitness Instructor will give a 5 -10 min overview on paddling techniques and safety. After that we’ll get you on the boards in a kneeling position.<br>\n\n We will paddle on our knees for a few minutes then as you gain stability and confidence we will progress to a standing paddling position. We have taught people to paddle from 10 to 72 years old and everyone has left with huge smiles on their faces and a great sense of accomplishment at having stood up on a paddle board. We will work on making you a confident &amp; safe paddler. Most of all we want you to have FUN on the water!

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> \n<p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> \n<p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> \n<p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> \n<p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> \n<p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> \n<p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> \n<p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> \n<p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.&nbsp; Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> \n<br>\n<p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> \n<p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> \n<p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> \n<p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> \n<p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> \n<p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> \n<p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> \n<p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> \n<p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> \n<p><br> <\/p> \n<p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> \n<p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The park ranges in elevation from about 1,400 feet to over 2,500 feet. Goldmine Mountain is located in the northeast area, with a spectacular San Tan Mountain escarpment in the southern portion of the park. The vegetation varies from creosote flats to dense saguaro forests. Various types of wildlife may be observed, including reptiles, birds, mammals and arthropods. The park is rich with unique historical, cultural and biological resources.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/7\/e\/600_434971102.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Caught in the dark at San Tan Mountain Regional Park.&nbsp; Photo: San Tan Mountain Regional Park.<\/p>\n<p>The Visitor Center at San Tan Mountain Regional Park has restroom facilities, souvenir items, wildlife exhibits&nbsp;and local artifacts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While at the park, take a few minutes to check out the small pond and the memorial near the parking area.

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p> \n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p> \n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p> \n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible. How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p> \n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission, saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life. Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","mtime":1425773721941,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Freeeventsformom\/events\/220997401\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":5400000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","id":"220997401","time":1426204800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"New York","name":"Free Events for Mom","group_lon":-73.99,"id":1614586,"state":"NY","urlname":"Freeeventsformom","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/8\/highres_13668280.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/8\/600_13668280.jpeg","photo_id":13668280,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/8\/thumb_13668280.jpeg"},"group_lat":40.74},"status":"suggested"}

They stop asking for what they want, stop getting the kind of love and attention they desire and start filling up on resentment instead of orgasm. They blame the guy and it’s all downhill from there. It’s a familiar story ending in disappointment, blame and tears.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that over-giving, running on fumes and people pleasing and therein lies the recipe for a woman who is filled with enough resentment to scorch a small village. She’s tense, stressed and tired all the time. Our culture encourages women running on empty as if it is a prize for the amount of love she holds.<\/p>\n<p>What if the opposite were true? What if a woman was deeply in touch with her sex and desire and filled up on orgasm and pleasure instead of resentment? What if she had a practice to help her fill up so that giving would be from true desire instead of obligation? What if women could have unconditional sex and be deeply connected to her partner and purpose at the same time?<\/p>\n<p>Join Brenda Fredericks Marino, Desire Coach and Orgasmic Meditation Trainer, in a lecture where she tells all. She will share her journey through relationships, sex, desire, and boundaries, all while parenting two teenagers and experiencing challenging career changes. She’ll pull the curtain back about how she shut down her sex and felt unfulfilled to the point of being totally disconnected from her body, truth and femininity. She’ll take you on the journey of how her own anger, hurt and resentment led to feeling disempowered and shut down. Through letting go of what she thought her life would look like, she gained back more than she ever dreamed possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>How did she do it? She added goddessly wisdom, self love and orgasm. By Orgasm, we don’t just mean that brief moment of climax, but a fullness of hydration, sensation and ignition. There is actually an endless well of energy that lives inside us that Brenda will take you through. In this interactive lecture, she will talk about what feeds this source: desire, sex, purpose, intmacy and relationship. She will discuss finding fuel in unexpected sources and how stepping out of your preferences and adding in a sense of play can bring the greatest turn on.<\/p>\n<p>Brenda has completely reinvented herself and is pure permission for what is possible. By giving herself permission, saying YES and living from a place of turn on, fullness and desire, she has transformed how she shows up in relationships, how she parents and will transmit how she feels deeply grounded in her truth, integrity and power. She has a regular OM practice and the most generative sensational sex of her life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join us for an insightful and playfully provocative evening all about the things we want to talk about most... but rarely do. Turn on your sex, your power, your life.<\/p>","name":"Living from Desire, a Lecture by Brenda Marino","group":{"id":1614586,"category":{"id":25,"name":"parents\/family","shortname":"parents-family"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/8\/600_13668280.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/8\/highres_13668280.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/8\/thumb_13668280.jpeg","photo_id":13668280},"group_lat":40.74,"name":"Free Events for Mom","state":"NY","group_lon":-73.99,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Freeeventsformom","country":"us","city":"New York"}}

Make sure to check out the debut of his presentation at Helium Comedy Club on the 18th.<\/p> \n<br> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcT6dx34x480%26list%3DPLEvx-dhQIelPoho8xDMdDpbQ2t8AuUhGg&amp;h=7AQEEiZ1g&amp;enc=AZMkakXUSwf-29uIcc3jkhk_O-ZR-rquK5DaZNmO0mfo3375r4YdV6gEy3HmI1Sghbw&amp;s=1\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cT6dx34x480&amp;list=PLEvx-dhQIelPoho8xDMdDpbQ2t8AuUhGg<\/a><\/p> \n<br> \n<br> \n<p>* * * * *<\/p> \n<br> \n<br> \n<p>Skeptics In The Pub is held in various forms around the globe, and we started a local chapter. It's a chance for like-minded people to get together for drinks, discuss things skeptic-related in a friendly, informal setting, and meet others who may not share views, but are interested in the topics.<\/p> \n<br> \n<br> \n<p>This is a meet-up and book club. Every other month, we vote on a new book to read on various topics of science and skepticism. Read at your own pace, or not at all. The point is to provide fuel for discussions.<\/p> \n<br> \n<br> \n<p>This event is free and open to the public. Please consider bringing a small donation to help us make this happen. We're planning to have guest speakers for future events, ranging from academics to comedians.

It is based on the fundamental principle that the body is self-repairing and has the innate ability to heal itself. It works on the principle that healing is accelerated by increasing the life force energy on what is in need of healing. This life force energy is transferred through the pranic healer to the person in need of healing. In our courses we teach people how to safely and easily transfer this healing energy.<\/b><\/p> \n<p>In this course, you learn the basics of working with your energy aura, including learning to \"scan,\" or feel the energy, to \"sweep,\" or clean away congested energy, and to \"energize,\" or supplement areas in your aura that have a pranic deficiency. You begin by learning to activate the energy centers, or \"chakras,\" in the center of your hands. This enables you to become sensitive to energy and scan a person's or your own energy field to identify blockages and then cleanse, energize and revitalize the area with new energy.<\/p> \n<p>Instructor: Allison Eibach<\/p> \n<p><span>It is necessary to register to take the class.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>","name":"Basic Pranic Healing Class","group":{"id":17362172,"category":{"id":14,"name":"health\/wellbeing","shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_lat":29,"name":"Pranic Healing and Holistic Medical Center","state":"FL","group_lon":-81.02,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Pranic-Healing-and-Holistic-Medical-Center","country":"us","city":"New Smyrna Beach"}}

Here is what you should expect:<br> \"Sigil Magick is hailed as one of the simplest, yet most powerful magickal disciplines in existence. It can be performed - and powerful results can be achieved - without any prior magickal experience, complicated rituals or elaborate paraphernalia. Only the raw materials of your own Will and Imagination are really required. Because Sigil Magick is so wonderfully simple the skill of it can be learned (Or, if you’re a seasoned Sigilizer, dramatically improved) in the space of one afternoon; this is the aim for today’s meetup!<br> In my talk I’ll cover WHAT Sigil Magick is and what it does, WHY you should do it - often and vigorously! -, and HOW it works. I’ll share the theory as well as dig out a few shining examples from my Treasure Chest of personal experience. I’ll also give examples of how the symbols and archetypes of the Tarot can be implemented in your Sigil Magick practice, to hone and fuel it further. Once everyone has gotten a firm grasp of the theoretical side of today’s topic we’ll all get stuck into Sigil Magick in practice!<\/p> \n<p>*Suitable for Tarot Readers and Magickians of all levels.<br> *Bring your Tarot Cards, pen and paper.<br> *Suggestion: Write down a few of your most prominent Desires and bring these to the meetup so you’ll have something worthwhile to work with!\"<\/p>","name":"Tarot and Sigil Magick: Manifest What You Will!","group":{"id":1429330,"category":{"id":22,"name":"new age\/spirituality","shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/1\/4\/600_13952276.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/1\/4\/highres_13952276.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/1\/4\/thumb_13952276.jpeg","photo_id":13952276},"group_lat":51.51,"name":"London Tarot Study Group","state":"17","group_lon":-0.13,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"London-Tarot-Study-Group","country":"gb","city":"London"}}

The Root River Trail offers 60 miles of paved bicycle trails. The trail winds through the valley of the Root River, past towering 300-foot limestone bluffs, forests and rolling fields. Along the way, you may also see wildlife including wild turkeys, deer, hawks and turkey vultures. Rattlesnakes can occasionally be found on rock outcrops, along the river bottoms, or sunning themselves on the trail. Lanesboro is at the heart of the Root River Trail, which branches out in three directions. Each day, there will be an option for a bike ride on one of the three branches of the trail.<br>We will gather each evening, beginning Friday, September 4, for a group dinner and to discuss plans for the following day. Some people may choose to join the bicycle ride, while others may choose canoeing, kayaking or tubing on the river (Root River Outfitters, Little River General Store), going for a tour of the Amish community (Amish Backroads Tour, R &amp; M Amish Tours, Bluffscape Amish Tours) or visiting the Eagle Bluff Environmental Learning Center or the Lanesboro Arts Center. There is a theater within walking distance of our motels, so that is an option for evening entertainment.<br>Click here for photos from previous rides.

We will have ample space to work in, allowing models and photographers to concentrate on a variety of creative ideas. Photographers are encouraged to bring items they need to be creative, keeping in mind to have any setups reasonable. Most props are encouraged (no weapon props or open flames) to help with adding originality. The model list will be updated as we get close to the event, so check back frequently for the latest additions.<\/p>\n<p>Of <b>special note <\/b>for this event, we are EXTREMELY pleased to present a very cool music experience. <b>Little War Twins<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.littlewartwins.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.littlewartwins.com\/<\/a>) will be performing a killer set of music that will be sure to please everyone.

Each noise a voice in itself, telling a story whether he wanted to hear it nor not, cascading from above, or rolling in from below. From all angles it came at him, tugging at his purposeful walk. Despite the shouts of angry patrons, or the cooing of false promises from the beauties he passed by, his feet kept him moving forward. The street lamps blanketed the sidewalk with their own cadence, as if he was walking across a chessboard. Trash cans stood as squat sentries, some overflowing with the debris of convenience, some with fire playing above the rim for a few seeking warmth. Puddles from the days rain were splashed at times by transporters whose passengers did not want to stop, but were still in search of something unspoken. The moon struggled to peak out around the shadowed clouds, hinting that the night was soon to be bathed in her fullness, even if the chill of darkness kept the body moving.<\/p>\n<p>He rounded the corner to find himself on Aramingo, or that's what it used to be called. His great-grandfather, affectionately called G-Papp, used to say that before the Great Change, the streets used to have metal signs that read with their name, and that people used cars or buses to get where they were going. His stories of traffic lights, pot holes, convenience stores, and the trappings of the Pre-Change culture seemed so far away. People used to walk and mingle on the streets as part of their daily lives, breathing the air without using a thelium tube. So strange to him! Breathing the air as it was, with no concern of a painful termination. To no such worries. It must have been quite an experience.<\/p>\n<p>His thoughts ended as approached the alley he knew well. A nondescript, typical entry way between sub domes, that was often shrouded by shadows of curving roofs. He was sure that while some things from the past were kept, much was abandoned to embrace the symmetry of the Ones. But alleys seemed to be harbor secrets, and this one held a special secret that not many knew of. Dropping his spare thelium tube on purpose, he bent to pick it up, making the signal with his thumb and forefinger. Within moments, a flash of light pierced out from the shadows of the alley, giving him clearance. He gave a cursory glance around him, knowing that for the next few seconds, the millions of cameras watching his every move would be hit with a few seconds of static, giving him enough time to step into the darkness and through the faux door that was opened for him.<\/p>\n<p>The only sound of the door closing was a faint bump, and then silence. The viso droids fluttered around him, scanning for any potential bugs or, as the old school term was called, a 'wire'. He wasn't worried, as he was a regular here, and they knew him. But familiarity did not mean access, and within moments he heard the beep of approval from the viso droids.<\/p>\n<p>Light spilled out in front of him as a second door opened up. He passed through, stepping out of the darkness and into the light, hearing then the voices of others who came here for the same purpose. It was a big crowd today, not the usual handful of people using their credits for a brief escape. He made sure he had a few extra vrillars to spend before walking over, allowing himself the luxury of options, something that he seldom had the chance to do.<\/p>\n<p>Placing his coat on a hook at his usual station, he sat before red screen he knew so well. He removed his thelium tube and placed it on the desk in front of him, and reamained still as the machine slowly encased him in what was affectionately called the pod. He felt his feet become secured to the floor, soon followed by his arms being locked down onto the arm rest, and then his head to the rest. The computer's voice then said \"Close your eyes, please,\" and he complied with out any fight. The machine felt a bit gruff to some, but he had long embraced the rigidity as a part of the process.<\/p>\n<p>\"Scanning thought waves,\" it said. A brief hum followed, which he called the tuning fork. It always reminded him of the nitrous gas one had to breath during implant process when he was young, when you didn't know enough to object to the mandated micro-chipping. You were old enough to know that something was going on, but too young to ask questions. But he learned to fix that problem later on, along with a few other things. He was one of the lucky ones.<\/p>\n<p>When the tuning fork was done, the machine's voice continued.<\/p>\n<p>\"Destination?\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Philadelphia,\" he responded. \"2015, April.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Stand by,\" it came back with. He could swear it sounded a slight bit agitated, but he often over thought such things.<\/p>\n<p>\"Pass code?\" it asked, sounding pleasantly inhuman but predictable.<\/p>\n<p>\"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux,\" he responded, as he felt the system begin the transport process. G-Papp always talked about how it was a life changing time for him, because he didn't have toys like this when he was young. He knew his great-grandfather, were he alive today, would be amazed at the ability to thought travel. He owed him everything, as G-Papp's DNA was in his blood too. That gave him access to so many experiences that he would otherwise never have. \"Does not compute. Repeat,\" came the response. Damn, this unit didn't have a translator installed, he thought. But it didn't matter which model he had, as they all did the same job. You work with what you got.<\/p>\n<p>\"Hear, See, Sexy, Light,\" he responded. And that was it. The machine took over, placing his body in the usual temp stasis, while his mind was then taken back to a date that made history.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/f\/a\/600_434974298.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>","name":"Audire, Videre, Lorem, Lux","group":{"id":521524,"category":{"id":8,"name":"fashion\/beauty","shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"group_photo":{"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/9\/e\/600_433746558.jpeg","highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/9\/e\/highres_433746558.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/9\/e\/thumb_433746558.jpeg","photo_id":433746558},"group_lat":40.12,"name":"Models + Photographers","state":"PA","group_lon":-75.01,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"ModelPhoto","country":"us","city":"Philadelphia"}}
